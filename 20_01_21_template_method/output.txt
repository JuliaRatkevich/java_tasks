AS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTH

IT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITY--FREE WILL.

NONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE, SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLE
NOW, THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION OR
AS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN, SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORY

THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE AND CHURCH ARE ERECTED.
ASTRONOMY, FAR FROM DESTROYING, EVEN STRENGTHENS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH
THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY IN HISTORY, LIKE THE LAW OF COPERNICUS IN
INEVITABILITY TODAY USE THAT LAW AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION, THOUGH
SO TOO, LIKE VOLTAIRE IN HIS TIME, UNINVITED DEFENDERS OF THE LAW OF

THOSE CONCEPTIONS.
AND ALL THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE AND CHURCH THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT UP ON
INEVITABILITY, TO DESTROY THE CONCEPTION OF THE SOUL, OF GOOD AND EVIL,
JUST SO IT NOW SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE ONLY TO ADMIT THE LAW OF

RELIGION.
RELIGION, AND HE UTILIZED THE LAW OF GRAVITATION AS A WEAPON AGAINST
VOLTAIRE FOR EXAMPLE, IT SEEMED THAT THE LAWS OF ASTRONOMY DESTROYED
SON OF NUN. TO THE DEFENDERS OF THE LAWS OF COPERNICUS AND NEWTON, TO
GOD, IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT, AND IN THE MIRACLE OF JOSHUA THE
IT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH IN
TO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY,

IS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTION.
THE LOSS OF THE WHOLE EDIFICE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE AGES, ON THE OTHER

JUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEEN

CONQUERED, THEOLOGY ESTABLISHED ITSELF JUST AS FIRMLY ON THE NEW
OLD VIEWS AND ACCUSED THE NEW OF VIOLATING REVELATION. BUT WHEN TRUTH

CHAPTER XII





INSEPARABLY INTERCONNECTED INFINITESIMAL ELEMENTS OF FREE WILL.
ASIDE THE CONCEPTION OF CAUSE, SHOULD SEEK THE LAWS COMMON TO ALL THE
NARRATION OF EPISODES IN THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS, IT TOO, SETTING
THE STUDY OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONS AND OF HUMANITY AND NOT THE
LAWS. HISTORY STANDS ON THE SAME PATH. AND IF HISTORY HAS FOR ITS OBJECT
THE NATURAL SCIENCES: LEAVING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF CAUSE, THEY SEEK FOR
FROM THE INFINITELY LARGE TO THE INFINITELY SMALL. THE SAME IS DONE BY
MOVEMENT OF THE BODIES, HE EXPRESSED THE PROPERTY COMMON TO ALL BODIES
ONE ANOTHER, THAT IS, LEAVING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF THE CAUSE OF THE
BODIES FROM THE LARGEST TO THE SMALLEST HAVE THE PROPERTY OF ATTRACTING
THAT THE SUN OR THE EARTH HAD A PROPERTY OF ATTRACTION; HE SAID THAT ALL
HAVE PROCEEDED. WHEN NEWTON ENUNCIATED THE LAW OF GRAVITY HE DID NOT SAY
IN ANOTHER FORM BUT ALONG THE SAME PATH OF REFLECTION THE OTHER SCIENCES

UNKNOWN, INFINITELY SMALL, ELEMENTS.
OF CAUSE, MATHEMATICS SEEKS LAW, THAT IS, THE PROPERTY COMMON TO ALL
OF UNKNOWN, INFINITELY SMALL, QUANTITIES. ABANDONING THE CONCEPTION
PROCESS OF ANALYSIS AND ENTERS ON THE NEW PROCESS OF THE INTEGRATION
INFINITESIMALS, MATHEMATICS, THE MOST EXACT OF SCIENCES, ABANDONS THE
ALL HUMAN SCIENCES HAVE TRAVELED ALONG THAT PATH. ARRIVING AT

THE CAUSES OF PHENOMENA--THE OLD METHOD OF HISTORY IS MOVING.
WITH THE SELF-DESTRUCTION TOWARD WHICH--EVER DISSECTING AND DISSECTING
THOUGHT WHICH HISTORY MUST ADOPT ARE BEING WORKED OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY
THE SEARCH FOR THESE LAWS HAS LONG BEEN BEGUN AND THE NEW METHODS OF

ITS PROBLEM.
INSTEAD OF SEEKING CAUSES, HISTORY WILL TAKE THE DISCOVERY OF LAWS AS
OURSELVES OF THE ABSOLUTE INACCESSIBILITY OF THE CAUSES, AND THEN
IS, BY REGARDING IT AS AN INFINITELY SMALL QUANTITY, CAN WE CONVINCE
ONLY BY REDUCING THIS ELEMENT OF FREE WILL TO THE INFINITESIMAL, THAT

IMPOSSIBLE.
IT AS A FORCE NOT SUBJECT TO LAW, THE EXISTENCE OF LAW BECOMES
FOR HOWEVER MAN'S FREE WILL MAY BE RESTRICTED, AS SOON AS WE RECOGNIZE
MAN'S FREEWILL, A SCIENTIFIC ENUNCIATION OF THOSE LAWS IS IMPOSSIBLE,
SUBJECT ON THE PATH IT NOW FOLLOWS, SEEKING THE CAUSES OF EVENTS IN
FROM THE STANDPOINT FROM WHICH THE SCIENCE OF HISTORY NOW REGARDS ITS

IS THE PROBLEM OF HISTORY.
EVIDENT ARE THE LAWS OF THAT MOVEMENT. TO DISCOVER AND DEFINE THOSE LAWS
THE MORE THIS FIELD OF MOTION SPREADS OUT BEFORE OUR EYES, THE MORE

DEPENDENCE ON CAUSE.
CONSCIOUSNESS OF MAN'S WILL IN THE PRESENT MOVES IN SPACE, TIME, AND
OF WHICH IS HIDDEN IN THE UNKNOWN BUT AT THE OTHER END OF WHICH A
FOR HISTORY, LINES EXIST OF THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN WILLS, ONE END

CAN EXIST, NOR ANY CONCEPTION OF HISTORICAL EVENTS.
ANY SINGLE ACTION IS DUE TO FREE WILL, THEN NOT A SINGLE HISTORICAL LAW
CONCEPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES ANY LONGER EXISTS. IF
MOVING FREELY, THEN THE LAWS OF KEPLER AND NEWTON ARE NEGATIVED AND NO
THAT IS, OF ANY SCIENCE WHATEVER. IF THERE IS EVEN A SINGLE BODY
THAT ASSUMPTION WOULD DESTROY THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF LAWS,

WOULD BE FOR ASTRONOMY.
HISTORY AS THE RECOGNITION OF A FREE FORCE MOVING THE HEAVENLY BODIES
HISTORICAL EVENTS, THAT IS, AS NOT SUBJECT TO LAWS, IS THE SAME FOR
THE RECOGNITION OF MAN'S FREE WILL AS SOMETHING CAPABLE OF INFLUENCING

ONLY IN SO FAR AS THIS FREE WILL IS DEFINED BY THOSE LAWS.
DEFINES THIS FREEDOM BY THE LAWS OF REASON, AND SO HISTORY IS A SCIENCE
WITH THE EXTERNAL WORLD IN TIME AND IN DEPENDENCE ON CAUSE, THAT IS, IT
HISTORY EXAMINES THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MAN'S FREE WILL IN CONNECTION


CHAPTER XI





HUMAN LIFE.
EXPRESSION FOR THE UNKNOWN REMAINDER OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE LAWS OF
WHAT IS UNKNOWN WE CALL FREE WILL. FREE WILL IS FOR HISTORY ONLY AN
SO ALSO IN HISTORY WHAT IS KNOWN TO US WE CALL LAWS OF INEVITABILITY,

OF THE ESSENCE OF LIFE.
ONLY AN EXPRESSION FOR THE UNKNOWN REMAINDER OVER AND ABOVE WHAT WE KNOW
INEVITABILITY, WHAT IS UNKNOWN TO US WE CALL VITAL FORCE. VITAL FORCE IS
IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCES WHAT WE KNOW WE CALL THE LAWS OF

METAPHYSICS.
THE SUBJECT OF HISTORY, WHILE FREE WILL ITSELF IS THE SUBJECT OF
IN HUMAN BEINGS IN SPACE, IN TIME, AND IN DEPENDENCE ON CAUSE FORMS
SUBJECT OF METAPHYSICS, EVEN THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FORCE OF FREE WILL
UNKNOWN ESSENCE OF LIFE WHILE THAT ESSENCE ITSELF CAN ONLY BE THE
BUT JUST AS THE SUBJECT OF EVERY SCIENCE IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THIS
SAME WAY DOES THE FORCE OF FREE WILL FORM THE CONTENT OF HISTORY.
ASTRONOMY, PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BOTANY, ZOOLOGY, AND SO ON, JUST IN THE
OF CHEMICAL AFFINITY, OR OF THE VITAL FORCE, FORMS THE CONTENT OF
THE UNDEFINABLE ESSENCE OF THE FORCES OF HEAT AND ELECTRICITY, OR
AND AS THE UNDEFINABLE ESSENCE OF THE FORCE MOVING THE HEAVENLY BODIES,

IT IS ONLY A MOMENTARY UNDEFINABLE SENSATION OF LIFE.
GRAVITATION, OR HEAT, OR THE FORCE THAT MAKES THINGS GROW; FOR REASON,
APART FROM THE LAWS OF REASON THAT DEFINE IT, DIFFERS IN NO WAY FROM
DEFINITION REASON GIVES IT. FREEDOM, APART FROM NECESSITY, THAT IS,
IS DISTINGUISHED BY REASON FROM THE OTHER FORCES OF NATURE ONLY BY THE
DIFFERENTLY DEFINED BY REASON. JUST SO THE FORCE OF MAN'S FREE WILL
AFFINITY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER IN THAT THEY ARE
ANY OTHER FORCE. THE FORCES OF GRAVITATION, ELECTRICITY, OR CHEMICAL
CONSCIOUS OF IT, BUT IN THE EYES OF REASON IT IN NO WAY DIFFERS FROM
MAN'S FREE WILL DIFFERS FROM EVERY OTHER FORCE IN THAT MAN IS DIRECTLY

LAWS OF REASON.
ALL KNOWLEDGE IS MERELY A BRINGING OF THIS ESSENCE OF LIFE UNDER THE

UP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOST COMPLEX ECONOMIC AND HISTORIC LAWS).
INEVITABILITY TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT (FROM THE FACT THAT EVERY MAN DIES,
CONSCIOUS, IS INTELLIGIBLE TO US ONLY IN AS FAR AS WE KNOW THE LAWS OF
FORCE OF FREE WILL, INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN ITSELF BUT OF WHICH EVERYONE IS
KNOWLEDGE THAT ALL BODIES HAVE WEIGHT, UP TO NEWTON'S LAW), SO TOO THE
KNOW THE LAWS OF INEVITABILITY TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT (FROM THE FIRST
FELT BY EVERY MAN, IS UNDERSTOOD BY US ONLY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE
BUT JUST AS THE FORCE OF GRAVITATION, INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN ITSELF BUT

WE CALL THAT FREEDOM.
FORCE, AND SO ON, BUT WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE FORCE OF LIFE IN MAN AND
THEM; WE CALL THOSE FORCES GRAVITATION, INERTIA, ELECTRICITY, ANIMAL
THE GREAT NATURAL FORCES LIE OUTSIDE US AND WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF

LIFE TO THE LAWS OF REASON.
RELATION OF THE FORCES OF NATURE TO INEVITABILITY, OR OF THE ESSENCE OF
ALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD OF NATURE IS ONLY A CERTAIN

WILL TO INEVITABILITY, THAT IS, OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE LAWS OF REASON.
ALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE LIFE OF MAN IS MERELY A CERTAIN RELATION OF FREE

ANOTHER AS FORM AND CONTENT, NO CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS POSSIBLE.
APART FROM THESE TWO CONCEPTS WHICH IN THEIR UNION MUTUALLY DEFINE ONE

ONLY BY UNITING THEM DO WE GET A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MAN'S LIFE.

INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONCEPTIONS OF FREEDOM AND INEVITABILITY.
AS FORM TO CONTENT, DO WE GET THE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND SEPARATELY
ONLY BY SEPARATING THE TWO SOURCES OF COGNITION, RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER

IS THE CONTENT. INEVITABILITY IS THE FORM.
FREEDOM IS THE THING EXAMINED. INEVITABILITY IS WHAT EXAMINES. FREEDOM

THREE FORMS.
CONSCIOUSNESS. INEVITABILITY WITHOUT CONTENT IS MAN'S REASON IN ITS
FREEDOM NOT LIMITED BY ANYTHING IS THE ESSENCE OF LIFE, IN MAN'S

GIVES EXPRESSION TO THE ESSENCE OF FREEDOM.
REASON GIVES EXPRESSION TO THE LAWS OF INEVITABILITY. CONSCIOUSNESS

TO BE THE CAUSE OF EVERY MANIFESTATION OF MY LIFE.
CONSEQUENTLY I AM OUTSIDE TIME. (3) I AM BEYOND CAUSE, FOR I FEEL MYSELF
MOMENT OF THE PRESENT IN WHICH ALONE I AM CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF AS LIVING,
CONSEQUENTLY I INCLUDE SPACE. (2) I MEASURE FLOWING TIME BY THE FIXED
CONSCIOUSNESS SAYS: (1) I ALONE AM, AND ALL THAT EXISTS IS BUT ME,

HAVE NO END.
(3) THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT HAS NO BEGINNING AND CAN
INFINITE MOTION WITHOUT A MOMENT OF REST AND IS UNTHINKABLE OTHERWISE.
VISIBILITY IS INFINITE, AND CANNOT BE IMAGINED OTHERWISE. (2) TIME IS
REASON SAYS: (1) SPACE WITH ALL THE FORMS OF MATTER THAT GIVE IT

ESSENCE OF LIFE, AND THE LAWS DEFINING THAT ESSENCE.
WHOLE OUTLOOK ON THE UNIVERSE IS CONSTRUCTED--THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE
WE SHOULD IN FACT HAVE REACHED THOSE TWO FUNDAMENTALS OF WHICH MAN'S

BE NOTHING, OR MERE CONTENT WITHOUT FORM.
CAUSE, WHICH BY THE FACT OF ITS BEING UNCONDITIONED AND UNLIMITED WOULD
SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AT UNCONDITIONED FREEDOM BEYOND SPACE, TIME, AND
IN THE SECOND CASE, IF FREEDOM WERE POSSIBLE WITHOUT INEVITABILITY WE

INEVITABILITY ITSELF, THAT IS, A MERE FORM WITHOUT CONTENT.
WE SHOULD HAVE REACHED A DEFINITION OF INEVITABILITY BY THE LAWS OF
IN THE FIRST CASE, IF INEVITABILITY WERE POSSIBLE WITHOUT FREEDOM

AND FREE FROM DEPENDENCE ON CAUSE.
INEVITABILITY, WE MUST IMAGINE HIM ALL ALONE, BEYOND SPACE, BEYOND TIME,
TO IMAGINE A MAN PERFECTLY FREE AND NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF

AND AN INFINITE SERIES OF CAUSES.
INFINITE NUMBER OF SPACE RELATIONS, AN INFINITELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME,
INEVITABILITY WITHOUT ANY FREEDOM, WE MUST ASSUME THE KNOWLEDGE OF AN
AND SO TO IMAGINE THE ACTION OF A MAN ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF

THE CONCEPTION OF A MAN'S COMPLETELY FREE ACTION.
INEVITABILITY WITHOUT ANY ELEMENT OF FREEDOM IS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE AS
SO THE CONCEPTION OF THE ACTION OF A MAN SUBJECT SOLELY TO THE LAW OF
EXAMINING, FOR AS SOON AS THERE IS NO FREEDOM THERE IS ALSO NO MAN. AND
SO DOING WE SHOULD DESTROY THE VERY CONCEPTION OF MAN IN THE CASE WE ARE
DYING MAN, AN UNBORN BABE, OR AN IDIOT--COMPLETE ABSENCE OF FREEDOM, BY
EQUAL ZERO, WE ASSUMED IN SOME GIVEN CASE--AS FOR INSTANCE IN THAT OF A
BUT BESIDES THIS, EVEN IF, ADMITTING THE REMAINING MINIMUM OF FREEDOM TO

NEVER REACH ABSOLUTE INEVITABILITY.
SHALL NEVER KNOW THE WHOLE CHAIN SINCE IT IS ENDLESS, AND SO AGAIN WE
(3) HOWEVER ACCESSIBLE MAY BE THE CHAIN OF CAUSATION OF ANY ACTION, WE

INEVITABILITY.
TIME IS INFINITE, AND SO IN THIS RESPECT TOO THERE CAN NEVER BE ABSOLUTE
EXAMINING AND THE JUDGMENT UPON IT, THAT PERIOD WILL BE FINITE, WHILE
(2) HOWEVER WE MAY PROLONG THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE ACTION WE ARE

REMAINS.
THERE IS NO COMPLETE INEVITABILITY BUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF FREEDOM
THEREFORE SO LONG AS NOT ALL THE CONDITIONS INFLUENCING MEN ARE DEFINED,
NUMBER OF THOSE CONDITIONS IS AS INFINITE AS THE INFINITY OF SPACE. AND
IN WHICH MAN IS SITUATED, THAT KNOWLEDGE CAN NEVER BE COMPLETE, FOR THE
(1) HOWEVER WE MAY INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITIONS OF SPACE

FREEDOM AND ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY.
IN THE SAME WAY WE CAN NEVER IMAGINE THE ACTION OF A MAN QUITE DEVOID OF

OUTSIDE OF TIME AND INDEPENDENT OF CAUSE, IS NO LONGER A MAN.
FREEDOM IN MAN, FOR A BEING UNINFLUENCED BY THE EXTERNAL WORLD, STANDING
ZERO, WE SHOULD EVEN THEN NOT HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CONCEPTION OF COMPLETE
TO ADMIT SO INFINITELY SMALL A REMAINDER OF INEVITABILITY AS EQUALED
ONLY HIS MOMENTARY ACTION IN THE PRESENT, UNEVOKED BY ANY CAUSE--WE WERE
BUT EVEN IF--IMAGINING A MAN QUITE EXEMPT FROM ALL INFLUENCES, EXAMINING

CAUSE IS THE CAUSE OF MY ACTION.
INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY CAUSE, BUT MY WISH TO PERFORM AN ACTION WITHOUT A
CAUSE NO PHENOMENON IS CONCEIVABLE. I RAISE MY ARM TO PERFORM AN ACTION
OF REASON IS THE ASSUMPTION OF AND SEARCH FOR A CAUSE, FOR WITHOUT A
EXPRESSION OF WILL IN ANY ACTION, OUR OWN OR ANOTHER'S, THE FIRST DEMAND
AN ABSENCE OF CAUSE. HOWEVER INACCESSIBLE TO US MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THE
INCREASED, WE NEVER REACH A CONCEPTION OF COMPLETE FREEDOM, THAT IS,
(3) HOWEVER MUCH THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES MAY BE

IS, OUTSIDE TIME, WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE.
IT IN THE PRESENT, ON THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURE--THAT
HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER. TO IMAGINE IT AS FREE, IT IS NECESSARY TO IMAGINE
COULD MAKE ONLY ONE MOVEMENT AT THAT SINGLE MOMENT OF TIME, IT COULD NOT
NOT PROVE THAT I COULD HAVE ABSTAINED FROM LIFTING IT THEN. AND SINCE I
WOULD BE THE ONLY ONE. THAT I DID NOT LIFT MY ARM A MOMENT LATER DOES
MOMENT I COULD MAKE ONLY ONE MOVEMENT, AND WHATEVER MOVEMENT I MADE
MOMENT IN WHICH THE FIRST MOVEMENT WAS MADE IS IRREVOCABLE, AND AT THAT
NOR IS THE AIR IN WHICH I LIFTED IT THE SAME THAT NOW SURROUNDS ME. THE
LIFTED IS NO LONGER THE SAME AS THE ARM I NOW REFRAIN FROM LIFTING,
QUESTION. TIME HAS GONE BY WHICH I COULD NOT DETAIN, THE ARM I THEN
NOT NOW ABSTAINING FROM DOING SO AT THE FIRST MOMENT WHEN I ASKED THE
CONVINCE MYSELF OF THIS I DO NOT LIFT IT THE NEXT MOMENT. BUT I AM
ABSTAINED FROM LIFTING MY ARM AT THE MOMENT THAT HAS ALREADY PASSED? TO
COMMITTED. CAN I LIFT MY ARM? I LIFT IT, BUT ASK MYSELF: COULD I HAVE
BEING FREE, FOR IT IS IRREVOCABLY LINKED TO THE MOMENT AT WHICH IT WAS
AN ACTION COMMITTED A SECOND AGO I MUST STILL RECOGNIZE IT AS NOT
DEED, WE NEVER GET A CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM IN TIME. FOR IF I EXAMINE
(2) HOWEVER MUCH WE APPROXIMATE THE TIME OF JUDGMENT TO THE TIME OF THE

EVIDENTLY IMPOSSIBLE.
CONCEIVE OF A MAN BEING FREE WE MUST IMAGINE HIM OUTSIDE SPACE, WHICH IS
TO BE FREE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD ENCOUNTER NO OBSTACLES. TO
DIRECTIONS BECAUSE IN IT THERE WERE FEWEST OBSTACLES. FOR MY ACTION
THE CONSTRUCTION OF MY OWN BODY. I CHOSE ONE OUT OF ALL THE POSSIBLE
LEAST OBSTRUCTION TO THAT ACTION EITHER FROM THINGS AROUND ME OR FROM
DIRECTION, I SEE THAT I RAISED IT IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THERE WAS
TO ME FREE; BUT ASKING MYSELF WHETHER I COULD RAISE MY ARM IN EVERY
HIM AND BY HIS OWN BODY. I LIFT MY ARM AND LET IT FALL. MY ACTION SEEMS
IN SPACE. EVERY HUMAN ACTION IS INEVITABLY CONDITIONED BY WHAT SURROUNDS
INFLUENCE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD, WE NEVER GET A CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM
(1) TO WHATEVER DEGREE WE MAY IMAGINE A MAN TO BE EXEMPT FROM THE

COMPLETE NECESSITY.
OF THE ACTION MAY BE--CAN WE EVER CONCEIVE EITHER COMPLETE FREEDOM OR
PERIOD OF TIME, HOWEVER INTELLIGIBLE OR INCOMPREHENSIBLE THE CAUSES
WORLD, HOWEVER INACCESSIBLE IT MAY BE TO US, HOWEVER LONG OR SHORT THE
WE MAY MAKE TO OURSELVES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE EXTERNAL
IN NEITHER CASE--HOWEVER WE MAY CHANGE OUR POINT OF VIEW, HOWEVER PLAIN

INEVITABILITY AND A MAXIMUM OF FREEDOM.
WHOSE ACTION ARE BEYOND OUR KEN, WE GET THE CONCEPTION OF A MINIMUM OF
CONDITIONS, WHOSE ACTION WAS PERFORMED VERY RECENTLY, AND THE CAUSES OF
MINIMUM OF FREE WILL. IF WE EXAMINE A MAN LITTLE DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL
ACCESSIBLE, WE GET THE CONCEPTION OF A MAXIMUM OF INEVITABILITY AND A
ITS EXAMINATION IS GREAT, AND WHERE THE CAUSES OF THE ACTION ARE MOST
EXTERNAL WORLD IS WELL KNOWN, WHERE THE TIME BETWEEN THE ACTION AND
SO THAT IF WE EXAMINE THE CASE OF A MAN WHOSE CONNECTION WITH THE

CONTEMPLATE A MAN'S LIFE.
GREATER OR LESSER DEPENDENCE ON THE CAUSES IN RELATION TO WHICH WE
EXTERNAL WORLD, THE GREATER OR LESSER REMOTENESS OF TIME, AND THE
OR INCREASES ACCORDING TO THE GREATER OR LESSER CONNECTION WITH THE
THUS OUR CONCEPTION OF FREE WILL AND INEVITABILITY GRADUALLY DIMINISHES


CHAPTER X





UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES THAT LED TO THE ACTION.
ACTION AND ITS INVESTIGATION, AND ACCORDING TO THE GREATER OR LESSER
TO THE GREATER OR LESSER INTERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN THE COMMISSION OF THE
WHICH THE MAN WAS PLACED WHOSE ACTION IS BEING JUDGED, AND ACCORDING
ACCORDING TO OUR GREATER OR LESSER KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN
BY ALL LEGISLATIVE CODES. THE RESPONSIBILITY APPEARS GREATER OR LESS
IRRESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIMES AND THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES ADMITTED
ON THESE THREE CONSIDERATIONS ALONE IS BASED THE CONCEPTION OF

WE CAN FORETELL THE RESULT.
LITTLE FREE WILL THAT AS SOON AS WE KNOW THE CAUSE PROMPTING THE ACTION
INTELLIGENCE IN QUESTION, WE SEE SO LARGE AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY AND SO
KNOWING THE CAUSES OF THE ACT AND THE SIMPLICITY OF THE CHARACTER AND
OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT, LIKE A CHILD, A MADMAN, OR A SIMPLETON--THEN,
IF THE MAN WHOSE ACTIONS WE ARE CONSIDERING IS ON A VERY LOW STAGE
ACTIONS THAT SEEM TO US LESS FREE THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THEIR CAUSE.
INTO BAD COMPANY, A DRUNKARD'S RELAPSE INTO DRUNKENNESS, AND SO ON ARE
SON OF A DISHONEST FATHER, THE MISCONDUCT OF A WOMAN WHO HAD FALLEN
THEIR INEVITABILITY WOULD BE STILL GREATER. THE DISHONEST CONDUCT OF THE
HAD A VAST NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS UNDER OBSERVATION, OUR CONCEPTION OF
CONNECT THE EFFECTS WITH THE CAUSES. IF WE EXAMINED SIMPLE ACTIONS AND
APPEAR TO US MORE UNDER COMPULSION AND LESS FREE THE MORE CORRECTLY WE
CORRELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IN PEOPLE'S ACTIONS, THEIR ACTIONS
OF EXAMPLES, IF OUR OBSERVATION IS CONSTANTLY DIRECTED TO SEEKING THE
WHAT THE WAY WAS PREPARED FOR HIS ACTIVITY. IF WE HAVE A LARGE RANGE
SECT OR PARTY, OR AN INVENTOR, IMPRESSES US LESS WHEN WE KNOW HOW OR BY
DESERVING OF SYMPATHY AND LESS THE RESULT OF FREE WILL. THE FOUNDER OF A
COMPREHENSIBLE THAN GRATUITOUS SELF-SACRIFICE, AND THEREFORE SEEMS LESS
OR MOTHER, OR SELF-SACRIFICE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A REWARD, IS MORE
FACTORS MITIGATES HIS FAULT IN OUR EYES. THE SELF-SACRIFICE OF A FATHER
OF THE APPARENTLY ORIGINAL ACTION. THAT A CRIMINAL WAS REARED AMONG MALE
OR THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE MERIT OF THE VIRTUOUS ACT, OR THE FREEDOM
ELEMENT OF NECESSITY AND ARE LESS INSISTENT ON PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIME,
THE INNUMERABLE CAUSES OF THE ACT IS KNOWN TO US WE RECOGNIZE A CERTAIN
MORE INDIVIDUALITY, ORIGINALITY, AND INDEPENDENCE. BUT IF EVEN ONE OF
RATE ITS MERIT MOST HIGHLY. IN AN INDIFFERENT CASE WE RECOGNIZE IN IT
DEMAND THE PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH AN ACT; IN THE CASE OF A VIRTUOUS ACT WE
GREATER AMOUNT OF FREEDOM TO IT. IN THE CASE OF A CRIME WE MOST URGENTLY
CRIME, A GOOD ACTION, OR EVEN ONE THAT IS SIMPLY NONMORAL, WE ASCRIBE A
WHEN WE DO NOT AT ALL UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE OF AN ACTION, WHETHER A

ACTIONS AND THOSE OF OTHERS APPEAR.
QUESTION, THE MORE SUBJECT TO INEVITABILITY AND THE LESS FREE DO OUR
OBSERVING AND THE LESS COMPLEX THE CHARACTER AND MIND OF THE MAN IN
AND HISTORICAL CAUSES OF THE ACTION, AND THE SIMPLER THE ACTION WE ARE
AND THE MORE CORRECTLY WE PERCEIVE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL,
HISTORICAL LAWS DEDUCED BY OBSERVATION AND BY WHICH MAN IS CONTROLLED,
THE BETTER WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND

WHAT WILL FOLLOW.
ITS DEFINITE PLACE AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE AND AS A CAUSE OF
PHENOMENON COMPREHENDED, AND THEREFORE MAN'S EVERY ACTION, MUST HAVE
ENDLESS CHAIN OF CAUSATION INEVITABLY DEMANDED BY REASON, IN WHICH EACH
THE THIRD CONSIDERATION IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE APPREHEND THAT

THE MORE MANIFEST THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY.
DOUBTFUL DOES THE FREE WILL OF THOSE CONCERNED IN THE EVENT BECOME AND
FARTHER BACK IN HISTORY THE OBJECT OF OUR OBSERVATION LIES, THE MORE
THE RENOVATION OF THE EUROPEAN WORLD DEPENDED ON ATTILA'S CAPRICE. THE
OF THE PEOPLES IT DOES NOT ENTER ANYONE'S HEAD TODAY TO SUPPOSE THAT
AS MERELY DUE TO THE WILL OF CERTAIN PEOPLE. IN REGARD TO THE MIGRATION
OF EUROPE, THOUGH TO THE CHRONICLERS OF THE CRUSADES THAT EVENT APPEARED
PLACE IN HISTORY AND WITHOUT WHICH WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE MODERN HISTORY
WILL. BUT IN THE CRUSADES WE ALREADY SEE AN EVENT OCCUPYING ITS DEFINITE
TO US, THOUGH ALREADY QUESTIONABLY, TO BE THE OUTCOME OF THEIR HEROES'
CRAFTY CONDUCT OF BISMARCK, AND SO ON. THE NAPOLEONIC WARS STILL SEEM
THE AUSTRO-PRUSSIAN WAR APPEARS TO US UNDOUBTEDLY THE RESULT OF THE

THEY APPEAR.
AND THE FARTHER WE GO BACK IN EXAMINING EVENTS THE LESS ARBITRARY DO
INEVITABLE RESULTS WHICH PREVENT OUR CONSIDERING ANYTHING ELSE POSSIBLE.
KNOWN PARTICIPANTS, BUT WITH A MORE REMOTE EVENT WE ALREADY SEE ITS
CONTEMPORARY EVENT SEEMS TO US TO BE INDUBITABLY THE DOING OF ALL THE
THE PART PLAYED BY FREE WILL IN THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF HUMANITY. A
IN HISTORY WE FIND A VERY SIMILAR PROGRESS OF CONVICTION CONCERNING

ACTION.
JUDGMENT, THE MORE DOUBTFUL BECOMES MY BELIEF IN THE FREEDOM OF MY
IN MEMORY, OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING THE FARTHER I GO FORWARD IN MY
HAPPENED HAD THAT ACTION NOT BEEN PERFORMED. THE FARTHER I GO BACK
ARE STILL PLAINER TO ME AND I FIND IT HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE
MORE REMOTE, TEN YEARS AGO OR MORE, THEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTION
ESSENTIAL--WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. IF I REFLECT ON AN ACTION STILL
NOT BEEN COMMITTED MUCH THAT RESULTED FROM IT--GOOD, AGREEABLE, AND EVEN
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, I CANNOT HELP RECOGNIZING THAT IF THAT ACT HAD
FREE. BUT IF I EXAMINE AN ACT PERFORMED A MONTH AGO, THEN BEING IN
CIRCUMSTANCES AS THOSE I AM IN NOW, MY ACTION APPEARS TO ME UNDOUBTEDLY
IF I EXAMINE AN ACT I PERFORMED A MOMENT AGO IN APPROXIMATELY THE SAME

OF THE ACTION AND OUR JUDGMENT OF IT.
RESPECT ON THE GREATER OR LESSER LAPSE OF TIME BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE
THE DEGREE OF OUR CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM OR INEVITABILITY DEPENDS IN THIS

OF A CONTEMPORARY, THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN TO ME.
AND ARE CONNECTED WITH ME IN TIME CANNOT SEEM TO ME AS FREE AS THE LIFE
THE REASON WHY THE LIFE AND ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVED CENTURIES AGO
APPEAR EVIDENTLY LESS FREE THAN A MAN'S ENTRY INTO MARRIAGE TODAY. IT IS
FALL OF THE FIRST MAN, RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RACE,
THE MAN'S ACTION OCCUPIES IN TIME. THAT IS THE GROUND WHICH MAKES THE
THE MAN TO THE WORLD AND THE CLEARNESS OF OUR PERCEPTION OF THE PLACE
THE SECOND CONSIDERATION IS THE MORE OR LESS EVIDENT TIME RELATION OF

WEIGHS ON HIM INCREASES.
HIS FREEDOM DIMINISHES AND THE MORE OUR CONCEPTION OF THE NECESSITY THAT
AND THE MORE WE PERCEIVE OF THESE INFLUENCES THE MORE OUR CONCEPTION OF
HAS AN INFLUENCE ON HIM AND CONTROLS AT LEAST SOME SIDE OF HIS ACTIVITY.
FALLS ON THE THINGS ABOUT HIM--WE SEE THAT EACH OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
WHICH HE IS ENGAGED, EVEN WITH THE AIR HE BREATHES OR THE LIGHT THAT
WHATEVER--WITH A MAN WHO SPEAKS TO HIM, A BOOK HE READS, THE WORK ON
TO ANYTHING AROUND HIM, IF WE SEE HIS CONNECTION WITH ANYTHING
HIM, EACH ACTION OF HIS SEEMS TO US FREE. BUT IF WE SEE HIS RELATION
IF WE CONSIDER A MAN ALONE, APART FROM HIS RELATION TO EVERYTHING AROUND

SECLUSION.
AND MORE SUBJECT TO NECESSITY THAN THOSE OF A MAN LIVING IN SOLITUDE AND
BOUND BY FAMILY, OFFICIAL, OR BUSINESS DUTIES, SEEM CERTAINLY LESS FREE
CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH OTHERS IN A THICKLY POPULATED DISTRICT, OR OF ONE
THAN ONE STANDING ON DRY GROUND, AND THAT MAKES THE ACTIONS OF A MAN
EVIDENT THAT A DROWNING MAN IS LESS FREE AND MORE SUBJECT TO NECESSITY
IN RELATION TO EVERYTHING COEXISTING WITH HIM. THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT
OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFINITE POSITION OCCUPIED BY THE MAN
RELATION TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND THE GREATER OR LESSER CLEARNESS
THE FIRST CONSIDERATION IS THE CLEARNESS OF OUR PERCEPTION OF THE MAN'S

(3) HIS RELATION TO THE CAUSES LEADING TO THE ACTION.

(2) HIS RELATION TO TIME.

(1) THE RELATION TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD OF THE MAN WHO COMMITS THE DEEDS.

NECESSITY IS INCREASED AND DIMINISHED DEPEND ON THREE CONSIDERATIONS:
ALL CASES WITHOUT EXCEPTION IN WHICH OUR CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AND

FREEDOM.
AND HISTORY ITSELF UNDERSTAND ALIKE THIS RELATION BETWEEN NECESSITY AND
RELIGION, THE COMMON SENSE OF MANKIND, THE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCE,

NECESSITY THE SMALLER THE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AND VICE VERSA.
FROM WHICH THE ACTION IS REGARDED. SO THAT THE GREATER THE CONCEPTION OF
CORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED OR INCREASED, ACCORDING TO THE POINT OF VIEW
IS INCREASED OR DIMINISHED AND THE CONCEPTION OF COMPULSION IS
WHO DOES NOT KNOW IT. IN ALL THESE CASES THE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM
WHO COMMITTED THE ACTION, AND SEEMS MORE FREE AND LESS INEVITABLE TO ONE
FREE AND MORE INEVITABLE TO ONE WHO KNOWS THE MENTAL CONDITION OF HIM
ACTION OF AN INSANE, INTOXICATED, OR HIGHLY EXCITED MAN APPEARS LESS
EXAMINED IT THE DAY AFTER IT WAS COMMITTED. AND IN THE SAME WAY EVERY
CONSIDERS HIS ACTION AFTER TWENTY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED THAN TO ONE WHO
AND HIS ACTION MORE DUE TO THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY, TO SOMEONE WHO
HAS SINCE LIVED PEACEABLY AND HARMLESSLY IN SOCIETY SEEMS LESS GUILTY
AND SO ON. SIMILARLY A MAN WHO COMMITTED A MURDER TWENTY YEARS AGO AND
DROWNING, THAT THE MOTHER WAS HUNGRY, THAT THE SOLDIER WAS IN THE RANKS,
PLACED, AND MORE FREE TO ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE MAN WAS HIMSELF
NECESSITY, TO ONE WHO KNOWS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE WERE
MAN--SEEM LESS GUILTY, THAT IS, LESS FREE AND MORE SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF
TO DISCIPLINE WHO ON DUTY AT THE WORD OF COMMAND KILLS A DEFENSELESS
EXHAUSTED BY FEEDING HER BABY, WHO STEALS SOME FOOD; OR A MAN TRAINED
A SINKING MAN WHO CLUTCHES AT ANOTHER AND DROWNS HIM; OR A HUNGRY MOTHER

THEIR RELATION IS ALWAYS ONE OF INVERSE PROPORTION.
ACCORDING TO THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH THE ACTION IS REGARDED, BUT
THE PROPORTION OF FREEDOM TO INEVITABILITY DECREASES AND INCREASES

THE MORE INEVITABILITY THE LESS FREEDOM.
FREEDOM WE SEE IN ANY ACTION THE LESS INEVITABILITY DO WE PERCEIVE, AND
FREEDOM AND A CERTAIN MEASURE OF INEVITABILITY. AND ALWAYS THE MORE
INEVITABILITY. IN EVERY ACTION WE EXAMINE WE SEE A CERTAIN MEASURE OF
EVERY HUMAN ACTION APPEARS TO US AS A CERTAIN COMBINATION OF FREEDOM AND
DIFFERENCES IN THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH WE REGARD THE EVENT, BUT
OUR CONCEPTION OF THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM OFTEN VARIES ACCORDING TO

FOR US.
INEVITABILITY GOVERNING THE ACTIONS OF THESE PEOPLE IS CLEARLY DEFINED
WALK, WE ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY CONTRADICTION. THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM AND
ACTION AN HOUR AGO IN CHOOSING ONE DIRECTION OUT OF SEVERAL FOR HIS
OF THE BARBARIANS, OR OF THE DECREES OF NAPOLEON III, OR OF SOMEONE'S
WHETHER WE SPEAK OF THE MIGRATION OF THE PEOPLES AND THE INCURSIONS

WILL AND PARTLY OF THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY.
WE MAY CONSIDER, WE ALWAYS REGARD IT AS THE RESULT PARTLY OF MAN'S FREE
WHATEVER PRESENTATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF MANY MEN OR OF AN INDIVIDUAL

DEPENDENT ON THESE TWO ELEMENTS.
QUANTITY OF PHENOMENA OF WHICH IT IS COGNIZANT AND THAT ALWAYS APPEAR
CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AND INEVITABILITY THEMSELVES FROM THE IMMENSE
UNDER THOSE DEFINITIONS, HISTORY SHOULD DEDUCE A DEFINITION OF THE
INEVITABILITY IN THEMSELVES, AND THEN RANGING THE PHENOMENA OF LIFE
SCIENCES. INSTEAD OF FIRST DEFINING THE CONCEPTIONS OF FREEDOM AND
OF HISTORY CAN AND SHOULD FOLLOW A PATH CONTRARY TO THAT TAKEN BY OTHER
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS, THE PHILOSOPHY
TO SOLVE THE QUESTION OF HOW FREEDOM AND NECESSITY ARE COMBINED AND

EACH EVENT PRESENTS ITSELF AS PARTLY FREE AND PARTLY COMPULSORY.
AND DEFINITELY UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF CONTRADICTION, ALTHOUGH
IN ACTUAL LIFE EACH HISTORIC EVENT, EACH HUMAN ACTION, IS VERY CLEARLY

TAKEN PLACE.
MAN'S LIFE IN WHICH THE UNION OF THESE TWO CONTRADICTIONS HAS ALREADY
FOR THEOLOGY, ETHICS, AND PHILOSOPHY. HISTORY SURVEYS A PRESENTATION OF
INCOMPATIBILITY OF FREE WILL AND INEVITABILITY DOES NOT EXIST AS IT DOES
AND SO FOR HISTORY, THE INSOLUBLE MYSTERY PRESENTED BY THE

IT.
THE SUBJECT FOR HISTORY IS NOT MAN'S WILL ITSELF BUT OUR PRESENTATION OF

EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE STANDS TO ABSTRACT SCIENCE.
IN REGARD TO THIS QUESTION, HISTORY STANDS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES AS

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
TO THE ESSENCE OF MAN'S FREE WILL BUT ITS MANIFESTATION IN THE PAST AND
QUESTION IS DEALT WITH, THAT FOR HISTORY THIS QUESTION DOES NOT REFER
HAS THIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH THE
FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION OF FREE WILL OR INEVITABILITY, HISTORY

SO SMOOTH AND REGULAR.
DELIGHTED THAT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW AS PLASTERERS, EVERYTHING IS NOW
WINDOWS, ICONS, WOODWORK, AND STILL UNBUTTRESSED WALLS, AND SHOULD BE
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WORK, SHOULD IN AN ACCESS OF ZEAL PLASTER OVER THE
A CHURCH WHO, AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE ABSENCE OF THE CHIEF
QUESTION, ARE LIKE PLASTERERS SET TO PLASTER ONE SIDE OF THE WALLS OF
THE NATURALISTS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS, THINKING THEY CAN SOLVE THIS

CONSCIOUSNESS AS WELL AS THE MUSCULAR AND NERVOUS ACTIVITY.
OBSERVE ONLY THE MUSCULAR NERVOUS ACTIVITY, BUT IN MAN WE OBSERVE
PHYSIOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY, FOR IN A FROG, A RABBIT, OR AN APE, WE CAN
NECESSITY TO WHICH HE IS SUBJECT CANNOT BE SOLVED BY COMPARATIVE
MAN'S CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM IS TO BE RECONCILED WITH THE LAW OF
TIME, IN THE SECOND CASE IT IS THE ORIGIN); AND THE QUESTION OF HOW
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME (IN THE FIRST CASE THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IS THE
AS COMPREHENSIBLE AS THAT THEY WERE MADE FROM A HANDFUL OF EARTH AT A
IF MEN DESCENDED FROM THE APES AT AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME, THAT IS

BASED ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM.
BREADTH THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION, WHICH HAS ANOTHER, OPPOSITE, SIDE,
SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF NECESSITY; BUT IT DOES NOT ADVANCE BY A HAIR'S
PHILOSOPHIC THEORIES--THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF REASON MAN IS
THE TRUTH ADMITTED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO BY ALL THE RELIGIOUS AND
AT SOME UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME, ONLY EXPLAINS FROM A FRESH SIDE
THAT MAN FOLLOWING THE GENERAL LAW MAY HAVE DEVELOPED FROM LOWER ANIMALS
OBSERVATION, REASON AND THE WILL ARE MERELY SECRETIONS OF THE BRAIN, AND
OF ONE SIDE OF IT. FOR THE FACT THAT, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF
THIS MATTER IS MERELY TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE ILLUMINATION
BEEN DENIED. THEY DO NOT SEE THAT THE ROLE OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES IN
ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL THE RELIGIONS AND ALL THE THINKERS, BUT HAS NEVER
TRYING TO PROVE BY PHYSIOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY WAS NOT MERELY
YEARS AGO THAT SAME LAW OF NECESSITY WHICH WITH SUCH ARDOR THEY ARE NOW
FROM THE APES. THEY SAY THIS, NOT AT ALL SUSPECTING THAT THOUSANDS OF
FREE WILL DO NOT EXIST BECAUSE AT AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME WE SPRANG
MOVEMENTS ARE CONDITIONED BY THE ACTIVITY OF THE NERVES; THE SOUL AND
FOR THE LIFE OF MAN IS EXPRESSED BY MUSCULAR MOVEMENTS AND MUSCULAR
THEY SAY AND WRITE AND PRINT THAT THE SOUL AND FREEDOM DO NOT EXIST,

SIDE OF THE QUESTION FOR A SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM.
IGNORAMUSES--HAVE TAKEN THE WORK OF THE NATURALISTS WHO DEAL WITH ONE
TIME THE MAJORITY OF SO-CALLED ADVANCED PEOPLE--THAT IS, THE CROWD OF
BEEN PUT ON A LEVEL ON WHICH THE QUESTION ITSELF CANNOT EXIST. IN OUR
DIFFUSION OF PRINTED MATTER--HAS THE QUESTION OF THE FREEDOM OF WILL
KNOWLEDGE--THANKS TO THAT MOST POWERFUL ENGINE OF IGNORANCE, THE
ONLY IN OUR SELF-CONFIDENT DAY OF THE POPULARIZATION OF

THE CONSTRAINED, ACTIVITY OF MAN? THAT IS A QUESTION FOR HISTORY.
OF HUMANITY BE REGARDED--AS THE RESULT OF THE FREE, OR AS THE RESULT OF
CONNECTION APPEARS TO BE FREE. HOW SHOULD THE PAST LIFE OF NATIONS AND
TO LAWS WHICH DETERMINE THAT LIFE. BUT THE SAME MAN APART FROM THAT
MAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE GENERAL LIFE OF HUMANITY APPEARS SUBJECT

QUESTION FOR ETHICS.
IN ACTIONS THAT FOLLOWS FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM? THAT IS A
UPON HIM. WHAT IS CONSCIENCE AND THE PERCEPTION OF RIGHT AND WRONG
MAN'S ACTIONS PROCEED FROM HIS INNATE CHARACTER AND THE MOTIVES ACTING

JURISPRUDENCE.
WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM? THAT IS A QUESTION FOR
STATISTICS. WHAT IS MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY, THE CONCEPTION OF
THE ACTIONS OF MEN ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL IMMUTABLE LAWS EXPRESSED IN

MAN'S FREEDOM? THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THEOLOGY.
WHAT IS SIN, THE CONCEPTION OF WHICH ARISES FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
MAN IS THE CREATION OF AN ALL-POWERFUL, ALL-GOOD, AND ALL-SEEING GOD.

IS POSSIBLE CONSTITUTES THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION.
WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THIS CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT WHICH NO CONCEPTION OF MAN
EXPERIMENT OR ARGUMENT, RECOGNIZED BY ALL THINKERS AND FELT BY EVERYONE
THIS UNSHAKABLE, IRREFUTABLE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM, UNCONTROLLED BY

PROVES THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT SUBJECT TO REASON.
THE SAME INSTANT OF TIME, OR OF AN EFFECT WITHOUT A CAUSE, THAT ONLY
CONTRADICTION LIKE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING TWO ACTIONS AT ONE AND
IF THE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM APPEARS TO REASON TO BE A SENSELESS

LIFE.
A MAN HAVING NO FREEDOM CANNOT BE CONCEIVED OF EXCEPT AS DEPRIVED OF

VIRTUE AND VICE, ARE ONLY GREATER OR LESSER DEGREES OF FREEDOM.
DISEASE, CULTURE AND IGNORANCE, WORK AND LEISURE, REPLETION AND HUNGER,
OBSCURITY, POWER AND SUBORDINATION, STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS, HEALTH AND
ARE ONLY EFFORTS TO INCREASE FREEDOM. WEALTH AND POVERTY, FAME AND

BE UNABLE TO LIVE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT.
OF FREEDOM NOT ONLY WOULD HE BE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND LIFE, BUT HE WOULD

CONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF FREEDOM) HE CANNOT IMAGINE LIFE. HE FEELS
SAME CONDITIONS, FEELS THAT WITHOUT THIS IRRATIONAL CONCEPTION (WHICH
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE TWO DIFFERENT COURSES OF ACTION IN PRECISELY THE
INCONTESTABLY REASON AND EXPERIMENT MAY PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS
THAT HE CAN ACT AS HE PLEASES. EVERY MAN, SAVAGE OR SAGE, HOWEVER
SAME WAY, HE FEELS AS CERTAINLY CONVINCED AS BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT
HE APPROACHES FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME THE ACTION THAT ALWAYS ENDS IN THE

SAME CONDITIONS AND WITH THE SAME CHARACTER HE WILL DO THE SAME THING AS
HOWEVER OFTEN EXPERIMENT AND REASONING MAY SHOW A MAN THAT UNDER THE

NOT AND CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.
BUT LEARNING JUST AS CERTAINLY THAT HIS WILL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS, HE DOES

THAT HE HAS LEARNED TO BE FULFILLED.
DOWNWARDS, A MAN INDUBITABLY BELIEVES THIS AND ALWAYS EXPECTS THE LAW
HAVING LEARNED FROM EXPERIMENT AND ARGUMENT THAT A STONE FALLS
MAN NEVER SUBMITS TO THE DEDUCTIONS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS AND ARGUMENTS.
ON HIS ORGANIZATION, HIS CHARACTER, AND THE MOTIVES ACTING UPON HIM; YET
CONSCIOUS IN HIMSELF IS IMPOSSIBLE, AND THAT HIS EVERY ACTION DEPENDS
AND ARGUMENTS PROVES TO HIM THAT THE COMPLETE FREEDOM OF WHICH HE IS
HAS BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEM. BUT THE SAME SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS
THEM AND NEVER RESISTS THE LAWS OF GRAVITY OR IMPERMEABILITY ONCE HE
AN OBJECT OF OBSERVATION, IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LAWS, AND MAN SUBMITS TO
A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND ARGUMENTS PROVES TO EVERY MAN THAT HE, AS

INCONCEIVABLE.
TO EXPERIENCE, BUT IN FACT SUCH SUBJECTION DOES NOT EXIST AND IS
SOURCE OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REASONING AND
IF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM WERE NOT A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT

REASON.
THAT REPLY IS THE EXPRESSION OF A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO

DEMONSTRATION OF FREEDOM.
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS ILLOGICAL REPLY IS AN IRREFUTABLE
YOU SAY: I AM NOT FREE. BUT I HAVE LIFTED MY HAND AND LET IT FALL.

TO BE LIMITED JUST BECAUSE HE IS NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT EXCEPT AS FREE.
IT. WERE IT NOT FREE IT COULD NOT BE LIMITED. A MAN'S WILL SEEMS TO HIM
NEVER-VARYING DIRECTION OF HIS WILL OTHERWISE THAN AS A LIMITATION OF
FOOD, USING HIS BRAIN, OR ANYTHING ELSE) HE CANNOT RECOGNIZE THIS
ONE AND THE SAME LAW (WHETHER HE OBSERVES THE NECESSITY OF TAKING

APART FROM CONSCIOUSNESS OF SELF NO OBSERVATION OR APPLICATION OF REASON

THROUGH CONSCIOUSNESS DOES HE KNOW HIMSELF.
INDEPENDENT OF REASON. THROUGH HIS REASON MAN OBSERVES HIMSELF, BUT ONLY
THIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SOURCE OF SELF-COGNITION QUITE APART FROM AND

WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF, WE FEEL OURSELVES TO BE FREE.
THAT EXISTS) IS SUBJECT. BUT REGARDING HIM FROM WITHIN OURSELVES AS WHAT
PHILOSOPHIC--WE FIND A GENERAL LAW OF NECESSITY TO WHICH HE (LIKE ALL
FROM WHATEVER POINT OF VIEW--THEOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL, ETHICAL, OR
THE PROBLEM IS THAT REGARDING MAN AS A SUBJECT OF OBSERVATION

FALSE PATH HISTORICAL SCIENCE HAS FOLLOWED ARE DUE SOLELY TO THE LACK OF
QUESTION. ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS AND OBSCURITIES OF HISTORY AND THE

WORDS THAT IT IS A LAW.
WE SAY THAT THIS IS SO BECAUSE IT IS UNTHINKABLE OTHERWISE, OR IN OTHER
PEOPLE COMBINE IN A CERTAIN FORMATION IN WHICH THEY ALL TAKE PART, AND
NOT KNOW. WE ONLY KNOW THAT TO PRODUCE THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACTION,
SAME APPLIES TO HISTORICAL EVENTS. WHY WAR AND REVOLUTION OCCUR WE DO
INCONCEIVABLE OTHERWISE, BECAUSE IT MUST BE SO AND THAT IT IS A LAW. THE
CANNOT SAY WHY THIS OCCURS, AND WE SAY THAT IT IS SO BECAUSE IT IS
SPEAKING OF THE INTERACTION OF HEAT AND ELECTRICITY AND OF ATOMS, WE

ELECTRICITY. ATOMS ATTRACT EACH OTHER AND ATOMS REPEL ONE ANOTHER.
PLAYING WITH THE SUBJECT. ELECTRICITY PRODUCES HEAT, HEAT PRODUCES
TO WHICH IN EVERY DOMAIN OF THOUGHT MAN'S REASON ARRIVES IF IT IS NOT
IN THE LAST ANALYSIS WE REACH THE CIRCLE OF INFINITY--THAT FINAL LIMIT

PHENOMENA WE ARE EXAMINING.
OR IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONCEPTION OF A CAUSE IS INAPPLICABLE TO THE

THE ONE NOR IN THE OTHER BUT IN THE UNION OF THE TWO.
INCONCEIVABLE WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL, THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT IS NEITHER IN
IT IS THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO THE POWER. BUT AS THE MORAL ACTIVITY IS
MORALLY THE WIELDER OF POWER APPEARS TO CAUSE THE EVENT; PHYSICALLY

RESPONSIBILITY AND VICE VERSA.
THE LARGEST DIRECT SHARE IN THE EVENT TAKE ON THEMSELVES THE LEAST
THE EVENTS, AND WHO ALWAYS COMBINE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THOSE TAKING
SUPPOSED, BUT BY THE ACTIVITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN
ACTIVITY, NOR EVEN BY A COMBINATION OF THE TWO AS HISTORIANS HAVE
(2) THE MOVEMENT OF NATIONS IS CAUSED NOT BY POWER, NOR BY INTELLECTUAL

HIS PARTICIPATION IN THAT ACTION.
JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE COLLECTIVE ACTION THAT IS PERFORMED, THE LESS IS
IN WHICH THE MORE THIS PERSON EXPRESSES OPINIONS, PREDICTIONS, AND
(1) POWER IS THE RELATION OF A GIVEN PERSON TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS,

(2) WHAT FORCE PRODUCES THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONS?

(1) WHAT IS POWER?

THESE TWO ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS OF HISTORY:
ARRIVING AT THIS CONCLUSION WE CAN REPLY DIRECTLY AND POSITIVELY TO

OF UTTERANCE ARE RELATED AS COMMANDS TO THE EVENTS.
PEOPLE SOME WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND WHICH BY THEIR MEANING AND THEIR TIME
MAY--THEN OUT OF ALL THE CONTINUALLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF DIFFERENT
OTHER CAUSES FOR IT, BUT AS SOON AS AN EVENT OCCURS--BE IT WHAT IT
COMMANDS WERE ISSUED, THE EVENT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE UNLESS THERE ARE
EVENTS. THE INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF THIS DEDUCTION IS THAT, HOWEVER MANY
THE PEOPLE, WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY AND THEIR ORDERS WERE DEPENDENT ON
THEMSELVES AND THE CONNECTION IN WHICH THE HISTORICAL PERSONS STOOD TO
THAT THE EVENTS DEPENDED ON THOSE COMMANDS. BUT EXAMINING THE EVENTS
WHICH, AS COMMANDS, WERE RELATED TO EVENTS, HISTORIANS HAVE ASSUMED
EXAMINING ONLY THOSE EXPRESSIONS OF THE WILL OF HISTORICAL PERSONS


MOVEMENT ALSO.
SEEMS TO US NOT MERELY TO MOVE OF ITSELF BUT TO GOVERN THE SHIP'S
DIRECTS NOR INCREASES ITS MOVEMENT FOAMS AHEAD OF IT, AND AT A DISTANCE
AND DECREED. WHEREVER THE SHIP MAY GO, THE RUSH OF WATER WHICH NEITHER
WHATEVER HAPPENS IT ALWAYS APPEARS THAT JUST THAT EVENT WAS FORESEEN

ANTICIPATING ITS MOVEMENT.
FREQUENTLY. BUT WHEREVER IT MAY TURN THERE ALWAYS WILL BE THE WAVE
AHEAD OF IT, WHEN IT TURNS FREQUENTLY THE WAVE AHEAD OF IT ALSO TURNS
WHEN THE SHIP MOVES IN ONE DIRECTION THERE IS ONE AND THE SAME WAVE

CHARACTERS (THAT IS, RE-ESTABLISH THE INEVITABLE CONDITION OF ALL THAT
WE SEE THE SAME IF WE WATCH MOMENT BY MOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF HISTORICAL

IMPERCEPTIBLY MOVING.
AND THAT WE WERE LED INTO ERROR BY THE FACT THAT WE OURSELVES WERE
EVERY BIT OF IT IS OCCASIONED BY THE FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP,
COMPARING IT WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP DO WE CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT
ONLY BY WATCHING CLOSELY MOMENT BY MOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF THAT FLOW AND

MOVEMENT OF THOSE WAVES WILL BE THE ONLY PERCEPTIBLE MOTION.
WILL ALWAYS BE NOTICEABLE AHEAD OF IT. TO THOSE ON BOARD THE SHIP THE

WISH AND, RECEIVING A JUSTIFICATION, PRESENTS ITSELF AS THE RESULT OF
THAT EVERY EVENT THAT OCCURS INEVITABLY COINCIDES WITH SOME EXPRESSED
UNITY, IN PATRIOTISM, IN THE BALANCE OF POWER, OR IN CIVILIZATION? SO
COLLECTIVE ACTION WHICH CANNOT FIND ITS JUSTIFICATION IN POLITICAL
MINISTERS, PARLIAMENTS, OR NEWSPAPERS BE IMAGINED? IS THERE ANY
CAN ANY EVENT THAT IS NOT PRESCRIBED, DECREED, OR ORDERED BY MONARCHS,
WITH THE PRESENT COMPLEX FORMS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE IN EUROPE

MURDER, AND SO ON?
IS IT THAT MILLIONS OF MEN COMMIT COLLECTIVE CRIMES--MAKE WAR, COMMIT
QUESTION THAT PRESENTS ITSELF WHEN EXAMINING EACH HISTORICAL EVENT. HOW
WITHOUT SUCH JUSTIFICATION THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY TO THE SIMPLEST

MEN'S MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES FROM THEIR PATH.
OF A LOCOMOTIVE TO CLEAR THE SNOW FROM THE RAILS IN FRONT: THEY CLEAR
RESPONSIBILITY. THESE TEMPORARY AIMS ARE LIKE THE BROOM FIXED IN FRONT
THESE JUSTIFICATIONS RELEASE THOSE WHO PRODUCE THE EVENTS FROM MORAL

JUSTIFICATIONS HAVE A VERY NECESSARY SIGNIFICANCE IN THEIR OWN DAY.
OF MILLIONS IN RUSSIA FOR THE HUMILIATION OF ENGLAND. BUT THESE
KILLING A MAN AS THE RESULT OF RECOGNIZING HIS RIGHTS, AND THE KILLING
EVENTS HAVE NO COMMON SENSE AND ARE ALL CONTRADICTORY, AS IN THE CASE OF
ENGLAND, AND SO ON. HISTORY SHOWS US THAT THESE JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE
WAS ACCOMPANIED BY PHRASES ABOUT THE GLORY OF FRANCE, THE BASENESS OF
FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST KILLING THEIR FELLOW MEN, AND THE EVENT
CENTRALIZATION OF POWER, RESISTANCE TO EUROPE, AND SO ON. MEN WENT
THIS EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ITS JUSTIFICATION IN THE NECESSITY FOR A
LIBERTY, AND FOR EQUALITY. PEOPLE CEASED TO KILL ONE ANOTHER, AND
PEOPLE'S BELIEF THAT THIS WAS NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF FRANCE, FOR
ONE ANOTHER. AND CORRESPONDING TO THE EVENT ITS JUSTIFICATION APPEARS IN
FOR REASONS KNOWN OR UNKNOWN TO US THE FRENCH BEGAN TO DROWN AND KILL

SURMISES CONCERNING THEIR COLLECTIVE ACTIVITY.
PART IN THE ACTIVITY TO DEVISE CONSIDERATIONS, JUSTIFICATIONS, AND
DONE BY A CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE, ALLOWING THOSE WHO DO NOT TAKE A DIRECT
ACTIVITY, AND GUIDE HIM IN PLANNING HIS FUTURE ACTIONS. JUST THE SAME IS
AS IT SEEMS TO HIM DIRECTED HIS PAST ACTIVITY, JUSTIFY HIS PRESENT
WHEN A MAN WORKS ALONE HE ALWAYS HAS A CERTAIN SET OF REFLECTIONS WHICH

GIVEN TO DIRECTING AND COMMANDING, TAKE LESS PART IN THE DIRECT WORK.
THERE IS A YET SHARPER DIVISION OF THOSE WHO, BECAUSE THEIR ACTIVITY IS
WHEN SOME LARGER CONCOURSE OF MEN DIRECT THEIR ACTIVITY TO A COMMON AIM

VERBAL ACTIVITY.
MORE WOULD EVIDENTLY WORK LESS WITH HIS HANDS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GREATER
WOULD RESULT FROM THE COMMON ACTIVITY; WHILE THE MAN WHO COMMANDED
THINK SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING, OR REFLECT ON OR COMMAND WHAT
IN THEIR PRIMARY FORM. THE MAN WHO WORKED MOST WITH HIS HANDS COULD NOT
DONE AS ONE OF THEM SAID. HE ORDERED IT. THERE WE HAVE COMMAND AND POWER
WHERE TO HAUL IT. THEY HAUL THE LOG AWAY, AND IT HAPPENS THAT THIS IS
MEN ARE HAULING A LOG. EACH OF THEM EXPRESSES HIS OPINION AS TO HOW AND

PRECEDING IT.
IS FULFILLED, THAT OPINION GETS CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT AS A COMMAND
FULFILLED IF BUT APPROXIMATELY. WHEN ONE OF THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED
MANY PEOPLE, SOME ONE OF THE OPINIONS OR WISHES EXPRESSED IS SURE TO BE
ABOUT IT, AND AS THE EVENT RESULTS FROM THE COLLECTIVE ACTIVITY OF
WHEN AN EVENT IS TAKING PLACE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS AND WISHES


CHAPTER VII





COMMANDING.
IN THE ACTION ITSELF AND THAT THEIR ACTIVITY IS EXCLUSIVELY DIRECTED TO
BY THE VERY NATURE OF THE CASE THOSE WHO COMMAND TAKE THE SMALLEST PART
RELATION BETWEEN THOSE WHO COMMAND AND THOSE WHO EXECUTE, WE FIND THAT
CORRESPONDING SERIES OF EVENTS. RESTORING THE ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF
WE FIND THAT A COMMAND IS EXECUTED ONLY WHEN IT IS RELATED TO A
HAVING RESTORED THE CONDITION OF TIME UNDER WHICH ALL EVENTS OCCUR,

CONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF THE CONCEPTION CALLED POWER.
THIS RELATION OF THE MEN WHO COMMAND TO THOSE THEY COMMAND IS WHAT

IN THE ACTION AND DIRECTS HIS ACTIVITY CHIEFLY TO COMMANDING.
THE LOWEST RANKS TO THE MAN AT THE TOP, WHO TAKES THE LEAST DIRECT SHARE
THEY COMMAND AND THE FEWER OF THEM THERE ARE; RISING IN THIS WAY FROM
WHILE THE LESS THEIR DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN THE ACTION ITSELF, THE MORE
THE ACTION THE LESS THEY CAN COMMAND AND THE MORE NUMEROUS THEY ARE,
IN SUCH RELATIONS THAT THE MORE DIRECTLY THEY PARTICIPATE IN PERFORMING
HIGHEST, WE SEE A LAW BY WHICH MEN, TO TAKE ASSOCIATED ACTION, COMBINE
ANY ADMINISTRATIVE OR PUBLIC BUSINESS WHATEVER FROM THE LOWEST TO THE
A CONE AND OF THE RANKS OF AN ARMY, OR THE RANKS AND POSITIONS IN
AND SO WITHOUT PARTICULARLY ANALYZING ALL THE CONTIGUOUS SECTIONS OF

FOR COMMON ACTIVITY--IN AGRICULTURE, TRADE, AND EVERY ADMINISTRATION.
RELATION OF PEOPLE TO ONE ANOTHER IS SEEN IN EVERY COMBINATION OF MEN
ORDERS CONCERNING THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASS OF THE TROOPS. A SIMILAR
NEVER TAKES DIRECT PART IN THE ACTION ITSELF, BUT ONLY GIVES GENERAL
OBJECTIVE, AND HARDLY EVER USES A WEAPON HIMSELF. THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
FREQUENTLY. A GENERAL DOES NOTHING BUT COMMAND THE TROOPS, INDICATES THE
OFFICER STILL LESS OFTEN ACTS DIRECTLY HIMSELF, BUT COMMANDS STILL MORE
FREQUENTLY THAN THE SOLDIERS, BUT THEY ALREADY GIVE COMMANDS. AN
OFFICERS (OF WHOM THERE ARE FEWER) PERFORM THE ACTION ITSELF LESS
FROM MEN ABOVE HIM; HE HIMSELF NEVER GIVES AN ORDER. THE NONCOMMISSIONED
BURNING, AND PILLAGING, AND ALWAYS RECEIVES ORDERS FOR THESE ACTIONS
THE CONE AND ITS BASE. THE SOLDIER HIMSELF DOES THE STABBING, HACKING,
THE SOLDIERS, OF WHOM THERE ARE THE MOST, FORM THE LOWER SECTION OF

WILL REPRESENT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
HIGHER GRADES OF THE ARMY, AND SO ON TO THE APEX, THE POINT OF WHICH
THE NEXT HIGHER AND SMALLER SECTION OF THE CONE CONSISTS OF THE NEXT
WHICH THE BASE WITH THE LARGEST DIAMETER CONSISTS OF THE RANK AND FILE;
A MILITARY ORGANIZATION MAY BE QUITE CORRECTLY COMPARED TO A CONE, OF

PERSON.
AND SO ON TO THE HIGHEST MILITARY COMMAND WHICH IS CONCENTRATED IN ONE
FEWER, AND OF STILL-HIGHER OFFICERS OF WHOM THERE ARE STILL FEWER,
MILITARY RANK--CORPORALS AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS OF WHOM THERE ARE
FILE--OF WHOM THERE ARE ALWAYS THE GREATEST NUMBER; OF THE NEXT HIGHER
EVERY ARMY IS COMPOSED OF LOWER GRADES OF THE SERVICE--THE RANK AND

THE MOST STRIKING AND DEFINITE EXAMPLES IS AN ARMY.
OF ALL THE COMBINATIONS IN WHICH MEN UNITE FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION ONE OF

THEY HAVE COMBINED.
SMALLER NUMBER A LESS DIRECT SHARE, IN THE COLLECTIVE ACTION FOR WHICH
ONE ANOTHER THAT THE LARGER NUMBER TAKE A MORE DIRECT SHARE, AND THE
MEN UNITING IN THESE COMBINATIONS ALWAYS ASSUME SUCH RELATIONS TOWARD

RELATION BETWEEN THOSE TAKING PART IN IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME.
REGARDLESS OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE AIMS SET FOR THE COMMON ACTION, THE
FOR COMMON ACTION PEOPLE ALWAYS UNITE IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS, IN WHICH

CALLED POWER. THIS RELATION CONSISTS IN THE FOLLOWING:
THIS RELATION OF THE COMMANDER TO THOSE HE COMMANDS IS JUST WHAT IS

HIMSELF TAKES PART IN THE EVENT.
THE DEITY BUT FROM A MAN, WHICH IS, THAT THE MAN WHO GIVES THE COMMAND
REINSTATE ANOTHER OMITTED CONDITION OF EVERY COMMAND PROCEEDING NOT FROM
TO UNDERSTAND IN WHAT THIS DEPENDENCE CONSISTS IT IS NECESSARY TO

CERTAIN DEFINITE DEPENDENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWO.
WE FIND THAT A COMMAND CAN NEVER BE THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT, BUT THAT A
SO THAT EXAMINING THE RELATION IN TIME OF THE COMMANDS TO THE EVENTS,

THE FIGURE CUT IN THE STENCIL.
THIS SIDE OR IN THAT WAY, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS LAID ON FROM ALL SIDES OVER
THIS OR THAT FIGURE COMES OUT NOT BECAUSE THE COLOR WAS LAID ON FROM
EVENTS THAT LED THE FRENCH ARMY INTO RUSSIA; JUST AS IN STENCIL WORK
OTHER, UNEXECUTED ORDERS BUT BECAUSE THEY COINCIDED WITH THE COURSE OF
WAS CARRIED OUT--NOT BECAUSE THOSE ORDERS DIFFERED IN ANY WAY FROM THE
OF UNEXECUTED ORDERS OF NAPOLEON'S ONE SERIES, FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF 1812,
HIS WILL, VERY VARIOUSLY AND INDEFINITELY DIRECTED. AMID A LONG SERIES
EXPRESSION OF THAT WISH, BUT FIND A SERIES OF ORDERS, OR EXPRESSIONS OF
REALITY IN ALL NAPOLEON'S ACTIVITY WE NEVER FIND ANYTHING RESEMBLING AN
WE SAY THAT NAPOLEON WISHED TO INVADE RUSSIA AND INVADED IT. IN

SERIES OF COMMANDS IS ALSO GENERALIZED INTO A SINGLE EXPRESSION OF WILL.
SERIES OF EVENTS, AND CORRESPONDING WITH THIS GENERALIZATION THE WHOLE
GENERALIZED INTO ONE EVENT IN ACCORD WITH THE RESULT PRODUCED BY THAT
FOR INSTANCE AS ALL THOSE WHICH LED THE FRENCH ARMIES TO RUSSIA, IS
ACCOUNTS A WHOLE SERIES OF INNUMERABLE, DIVERSE, AND PETTY EVENTS, SUCH
OF OUR ERROR IN THIS MATTER IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN THE HISTORICAL
EXECUTED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BE. APART FROM THAT, THE CHIEF SOURCE
EVENT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED, WE FORGET ABOUT THE OTHERS THAT WERE NOT
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS THOSE FEW COMMANDS WHICH WERE CONSISTENT WITH THAT
IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN THE EVENT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND OUT OF
OUR FALSE CONCEPTION THAT AN EVENT IS CAUSED BY A COMMAND WHICH PRECEDES

ARE EXECUTED.
CONSECUTIVE SERIES OF COMMANDS CORRESPONDING TO A SERIES OF EVENTS, AND
EVENTS REMAIN UNEXECUTED. ONLY THE POSSIBLE ONES GET LINKED UP WITH A
UNEXECUTED. ALL THE IMPOSSIBLE ORDERS INCONSISTENT WITH THE COURSE OF
EXECUTION. EVERY ORDER EXECUTED IS ALWAYS ONE OF AN IMMENSE NUMBER
FOR IN EITHER CASE MILLIONS OF OBSTACLES MAY ARISE TO PREVENT ITS
RUSSIA IN WHICH MILLIONS PARTICIPATED, BUT EVEN IN THE SIMPLEST EVENT,
EXECUTED IS IMPOSSIBLE, NOT ONLY IN THE CASE OF NAPOLEON'S INVASION OF
ORDER WHAT CAN BE EXECUTED. BUT TO KNOW WHAT CAN AND WHAT CANNOT BE
FOR AN ORDER TO BE CERTAINLY EXECUTED, IT IS NECESSARY THAT A MAN SHOULD

LATTER.

EXPRESSED)--THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE HIS COMMANDS DID NOT CORRESPOND TO
CONSIDERED IT DESIRABLE TO BE IN ALLIANCE (A CONVICTION HE REPEATEDLY
DESIGN BUT UNDERTOOK AN EXPEDITION INTO RUSSIA, WITH WHICH COUNTRY HE
AND YET DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN NEVER ONCE ATTEMPTED TO EXECUTE THAT
OF ENGLAND AND EXPENDED ON NO OTHER UNDERTAKING SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT,
IF THROUGHOUT HIS REIGN NAPOLEON GAVE COMMANDS CONCERNING AN INVASION

FRENCH ARMIES INTO RUSSIA.
A WHOLE SERIES CORRESPONDING TO A SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH BROUGHT THE
COMMISSARIAT, AND SO ON AND SO ON--MILLIONS OF COMMANDS, WHICH FORMED
TOMORROW SUCH AND SUCH DECREES AND ORDERS TO THE ARMY, THE FLEET, THE
PAPERS TO BE WRITTEN TO VIENNA, TO BERLIN, AND TO PETERSBURG;
AN INVASION OF RUSSIA AND NEVER DID SO. TODAY HE ORDERED SUCH AND SUCH
COMMANDS DEPENDENT ONE ON ANOTHER. NAPOLEON COULD NOT HAVE COMMANDED
WE COMBINE IN ONE SIMULTANEOUS EXPRESSION A WHOLE SERIES OF CONSECUTIVE
WHEN, FOR INSTANCE, WE SAY THAT NAPOLEON ORDERED ARMIES TO GO TO WAR,

TO A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS BUT ALWAYS TO ONE MOMENT ONLY OF AN EVENT.
OF OCCURRENCES; BUT EACH COMMAND FOLLOWS FROM ANOTHER, AND NEVER REFERS
NO COMMAND EVER APPEARS SPONTANEOUSLY, OR ITSELF COVERS A WHOLE SERIES

RENDERING THE EXECUTION OF THE LAST COMMAND POSSIBLE.
COMMAND CAN BE EXECUTED WITHOUT SOME PRECEDING ORDER HAVING BEEN GIVEN
REINSTATING THE FIRST CONDITION OMITTED, THAT OF TIME, WE SEE THAT NO

IN TIME AND HIMSELF TAKES PART IN WHAT OCCURS.
SOLE WILL DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF HUMANITY'S MOVEMENT; BUT MAN ACTS
CENTURIES, AND ONLY THE DEITY, INDEPENDENT OF EVERYTHING, CAN BY HIS
RELATE TO A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS OCCURRING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS OR
ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE DEITY, NOT DEPENDENT ON TIME, CAN

BETWEEN THE PERSON COMMANDING AND THOSE WHO EXECUTE HIS COMMAND.
OF THE PERSON WHO COMMANDS, AND (2) THE INEVITABILITY OF THE CONNECTION
TAKES PLACE: THE CONTINUITY OF MOVEMENT IN TIME BOTH OF THE EVENTS AND
COMMANDS WITH EVENTS WE MUST RESTORE: (1) THE CONDITION OF ALL THAT
IN TIME AND IN RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER, TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION OF
SPEAKING OF COMMANDS THAT ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF MEN ACTING
CAUSED BY ANYTHING, FOR THE DIVINITY IS NOT CONTROLLED BY AN EVENT. BUT
TELLS US, THE EXPRESSION OF THAT WILL IS INDEPENDENT OF TIME AND IS NOT
IF THE DEITY ISSUES A COMMAND, EXPRESSES HIS WILL, AS ANCIENT HISTORY

DEITY.
CONCEPTION OF THE EXPRESSION OF WILL, REFERRING IT TO MAN AND NOT TO THE
TO EXPLAIN THE CONDITIONS OF THAT RELATIONSHIP WE MUST FIRST ESTABLISH A

THAT WILL BY OTHERS.
EXISTS BETWEEN THE EXPRESSION OF SOMEONE'S WILL AND THE EXECUTION OF
POWER, FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EXPERIENCE, IS MERELY THE RELATION THAT

CANNOT REGARD "POWER" AS THE CAUSE OF EVENTS.
WITHOUT ADMITTING DIVINE INTERVENTION IN THE AFFAIRS OF HUMANITY WE

OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY ORDER OCCURS.
IS TO SAY, THEIR COMMANDS ARE OFTEN NOT EXECUTED, AND SOMETIMES THE VERY
HISTORICAL PERSONAGES DOES NOT IN MOST CASES PRODUCE ANY EFFECT, THAT
CAUSE OF EVENTS, HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF
MEN. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN IF WE ADMITTED THAT WORDS COULD BE THE
THAT WORDS CAN BE THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF MILLIONS OF
AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE, SUPERNATURAL FORCE--A MIRACLE--ONE CANNOT ADMIT
EVENT, AS FOR INSTANCE IN A WAR OR A REVOLUTION, AND SO WITHOUT ASSUMING
WILL--HIS WORDS--ARE ONLY PART OF THE GENERAL ACTIVITY EXPRESSED IN AN
ON THE ONE SIDE REFLECTION SHOWS THAT THE EXPRESSION OF A MAN'S

SUPPOSITION IS NOT CONFIRMED EITHER BY REASON OR BY EXPERIENCE.
THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF SOMEONE ENDOWED WITH POWER, BUT THAT
INTERVENTION IN HUMAN AFFAIRS, WANT TO SEE THE CAUSE OF EVENTS IN
THE HISTORIANS, IN ACCORD WITH THE OLD HABIT OF ACKNOWLEDGING DIVINE

RELATED TO THE WILL OF ONE OR OF SEVERAL MEN WHO HAVE DECREED IT.
BOURBONS. EXPERIENCE SHOWS US THAT WHATEVER EVENT OCCURS IT IS ALWAYS
RUSSIA. ALEXANDER I GIVES A COMMAND AND THE FRENCH SUBMIT TO THE
AN ARMY ENTERS BOHEMIA. NAPOLEON I ISSUES A DECREE AND AN ARMY ENTERS
FRENCH GO TO MEXICO. THE KING OF PRUSSIA AND BISMARCK ISSUE DECREES AND
EVENT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE. NAPOLEON III ISSUES A DECREE AND THE
WHENEVER AN EVENT OCCURS A MAN APPEARS OR MEN APPEAR, BY WHOSE WILL THE

OF MEN CAN DO WITHOUT THE CONCEPTION OF POWER, THE EXISTENCE OF POWER IS
NOT TO SPEAK OF THE FACT THAT NO DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLECTIVE ACTIVITY

AN ACTUALLY EXISTING PHENOMENON.
REFLECTIONS. AND EXPERIENCE TELLS US THAT POWER IS NOT MERELY A WORD BUT
HAS, BESIDES ABSTRACT REASONING, EXPERIENCE BY WHICH HE VERIFIES HIS
A WORD AND HAS NO REAL EXISTENCE. BUT TO UNDERSTAND PHENOMENA MAN
JURIDICAL SCIENCE GIVES US, HUMANITY WOULD CONCLUDE THAT POWER IS MERELY
THEN HAVING SUBJECTED TO CRITICISM THE EXPLANATION OF "POWER" THAT
IF THE REALM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE WERE CONFINED TO ABSTRACT REASONING,


WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
IS, POWER IS POWER: IN OTHER WORDS, POWER IS A WORD THE MEANING OF WHICH
CONDITION THAT THAT PERSON EXPRESSES THE WILL OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE. THAT
CONDITION IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE DELEGATED TO ONE PERSON? ON
COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED TO ONE PERSON. UNDER WHAT
WHAT CAUSES HISTORICAL EVENTS? POWER. WHAT IS POWER? POWER IS THE

WE MUST WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF ALL THE PROMINENT ANIMALS MOVING ON ALL

A GIVEN DIRECTION THE ANIMALS TRANSFER THEIR WILL TO THE ANIMALS THAT
THE WHOLE HERD IS CONSTANTLY ALTERED, THIS IS BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FOLLOW

OF OBSERVATION IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT THE OBSERVER, INFLUENCED BY THE
RULERS UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH THEY REGARD AS KNOWN. (WITH THIS METHOD

IT AND THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS IS VESTED IN THAT
"THE HERD GOES IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE THE ANIMAL IN FRONT LEADS

THE DIRECTION THE HERD TAKES TO WHAT ANIMAL HAPPENS TO BE AT ITS HEAD.
PARTS OF THE FIELD, OR TO THE DRIVING OF THE HERDSMAN, SHOULD ATTRIBUTE
PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE VARYING QUALITY OF THE PASTURAGE IN DIFFERENT
REPLIES OF A MAN WHO, WATCHING THE MOVEMENTS OF A HERD OF CATTLE AND
THE REPLIES THIS THEORY GIVES TO HISTORICAL QUESTIONS ARE LIKE THE

THE COLLECTIVE WILL WAS TRANSFERRED TO HIM.
THEORY CAN ALWAYS SAY THAT SUCH AND SUCH A PERSON TOOK THE LEAD BECAUSE
WHATEVER HAPPENS AND WHOEVER MAY STAND AT THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS, THE

PEOPLE'S WILL CANNOT BE VERIFIED, FOR IT NEVER OCCURRED.
THE THEORY SEEMS IRREFUTABLE JUST BECAUSE THE ACT OF TRANSFERENCE OF THE

HISTORY BEGINS--THAT THEORY EXPLAINS NOTHING.

CHAPTER V





THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLES.
HISTORIANS, WE SHALL HAVE THE HISTORY OF MONARCHS AND WRITERS, BUT NOT
IF WE UNITE BOTH THESE KINDS OF HISTORY, AS IS DONE BY THE NEWEST

FRENCH REVOLUTION THEY GUILLOTINED ONE ANOTHER.
THE REFORMATION THE PEOPLES MASSACRED ONE ANOTHER, NOR WHY DURING THE
SUSPICIOUS AND WROTE SUCH AND SUCH BOOKS; BUT WE DO NOT LEARN WHY AFTER
A HOT TEMPER AND SAID SUCH AND SUCH THINGS; WE LEARN THAT ROUSSEAU WAS
LIFE AND THOUGHT OF A WRITER OR A REFORMER. WE LEARN THAT LUTHER HAD
THE HISTORY OF CULTURE EXPLAINS TO US THE IMPULSES AND CONDITIONS OF

LIFE OF THE PEOPLES.
STILL LESS DOES THE HISTORY OF AUTHORS AND REFORMERS EXPLAIN TO US THE

AND THEIR IMPULSES HAS REMAINED UNKNOWN.
OF GODFREYS AND MINNESINGERS, BUT THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLES
HISTORY OF THE GODFREYS AND THE MINNESINGERS HAS REMAINED THE HISTORY
MINNESINGERS CAN EVIDENTLY NOT COVER THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLES. AND THE
THEM TO GO NO LONGER EXISTED. THE HISTORY OF THE GODFREYS AND THE
PEOPLE DID NOT GO, FOR THE UNKNOWN CAUSE WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY IMPELLED
KINGS, AND KNIGHTS INCITED THE PEOPLES TO FREE THE HOLY LAND; BUT THE
OF JERUSALEM--HAD BEEN CLEARLY DEFINED BY HISTORIC LEADERS. POPES,
MOVEMENT WHEN A RATIONAL AND SACRED AIM FOR THE CRUSADE--THE DELIVERANCE
INCOMPREHENSIBLE. AND YET MORE INCOMPREHENSIBLE IS THE CESSATION OF THAT
LEADERS, WITH A CROWD OF VAGRANTS, AND WITH PETER THE HERMIT, REMAINS
FOR US THAT MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLES FROM WEST TO EAST, WITHOUT
THE LIFE AND ACTIVITY OF THE GODFREYS AND THE LOUIS-ES AND THEIR LADIES?
IS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLES AT THE TIME OF THE CRUSADES EXPLAINED BY

HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH KURBSKI?
EXPRESSED BY DETAILS OF THE MORBID CHARACTER OF IVAN THE TERRIBLE AND BY
IS THE MOVEMENT OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE EASTWARD TO KAZAN AND SIBERIA

BEAUMARCHAIS, AND OTHERS?
AND MINISTERS, AND BY THE LIVES OF NAPOLEON, ROUSSEAU, DIDEROT,
EXPLAINED BY THE ACTIVITY OF LOUIS XIV, XV, AND XVI, THEIR MISTRESSES
THE WEST AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND THEIR DRIVE EASTWARD
HISTORY PROVES THIS AT EVERY TURN. IS THE FERMENT OF THE PEOPLES OF

AGRICULTURE, OR SLAY THEIR FELLOW CREATURES.
ACTIVITY OF SOME DOZEN PEOPLE WHO DID NOT BURN HOUSES, PRACTICE
AND DESTROY ONE ANOTHER NEVER IS EXPRESSED IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE
ACTIVITY OF THE MILLIONS WHO MIGRATE, BURN HOUSES, ABANDON AGRICULTURE,
ALWAYS TRANSFERRED TO THE MEN WHOM WE HAVE NOTICED, IT HAPPENS THAT THE
ON THE ARBITRARY ASSUMPTION THAT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS
OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE RULERS AND ENLIGHTENERS OF HUMANITY IS ONLY BASED
FREEDOM, EQUALITY, ENLIGHTENMENT, OR CIVILIZATION, AND AS THE CONNECTION
BUT AS IT IS IN NO WAY PROVED THAT THE AIM OF HUMANITY DOES CONSIST IN
THEIR OPINION THESE PERSONS HAVE PROMOTED OR HINDERED THAT ABSTRACTION.
AUTHORS, REFORMERS, POPES, AND JOURNALISTS, TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IN
GREATEST NUMBER OF MONUMENTS HAVE REMAINED: KINGS, MINISTERS, GENERALS,
OF THE MOVEMENT OF HUMANITY, THE HISTORIANS STUDY THE MEN OF WHOM THE
CIVILIZATION, AND CULTURE. POSTULATING SOME GENERALIZATION AS THE GOAL
ALL THE HISTORIANS ARE: FREEDOM, EQUALITY, ENLIGHTENMENT, PROGRESS,
HUMANITY'S MOVEMENT. THE MOST USUAL GENERALIZATIONS ADOPTED BY ALMOST
CONCEIVABLE OCCURRENCES, AND DECLARE THIS ABSTRACTION TO BE THE AIM OF
OBSCURE, IMPALPABLE, AND GENERAL ABSTRACTION WHICH CAN COVER ALL
MET BY THIS DIFFICULTY HISTORIANS OF THAT CLASS DEVISE SOME MOST

FIRST OF ALL TO KNOW IN WHAT THE NATION'S LIFE CONSISTS.
SIDE OF THE ACTIVITY OF A LEADER EXPRESSES THE NATION'S LIFE, WE HAVE
SO-CALLED "PHILOSOPHICAL" HISTORIANS BELIEVE, THEN TO DETERMINE WHICH
HISTORICAL LEADER WHICH SERVES TO EXPRESS THE PEOPLE'S LIFE, AS OTHER
NONSENSE; BUT IF IT IS ONLY SOME PARTICULAR SIDE OF THE ACTIVITY OF AN
A CATHERINE SERVE TO EXPRESS THE LIFE OF THE NATION, WHICH IS EVIDENT
OF THE COURT SCANDALS CONTAINED IN THE BIOGRAPHIES OF A NAPOLEON OR
THE PEOPLE'S WILL, AS SOME HISTORIANS SUPPOSE, THEN ALL THE DETAILS
OF IT. IF THE WHOLE ACTIVITY OF THE LEADERS SERVES AS THE EXPRESSION OF
LEADERS SERVES AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL OR ONLY SOME PART
BUT IN THAT CASE THE QUESTION ARISES WHETHER ALL THE ACTIVITY OF THE

THE ACTIVITY OF THE LEADERS REPRESENTS THE ACTIVITY OF THE PEOPLE.
THE LEADERS, THESE HISTORIANS TELL US, EXPRESS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE:

THOSE LEADERS?
HISTORIC LEADERS BUT IN THE NATIONS THEMSELVES, WHAT SIGNIFICANCE HAVE
BUT IN THAT CASE, IF THE FORCE THAT MOVES NATIONS LIES NOT IN THE

DELEGATED TO THEM.
POWER ONLY BECAUSE THEY FULFILL THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WHICH HAS BEEN
CONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN TO US. THEY SAY THAT HISTORICAL PERSONAGES HAVE
IS TRANSFERRED TO HISTORIC PERSONAGES CONDITIONALLY, BUT THAT THE
HISTORIANS OF THE THIRD CLASS ASSUME THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE

RESEMBLE TWO LEAVES, ARE DEVIATIONS FROM THE THEORY.
MUSHROOM, AND EVEN THE OAK, WHICH BLOSSOM INTO FULL GROWTH AND NO LONGER
THAT GROWS DOES SO BY SPROUTING INTO TWO LEAVES, AND THAT THE PALM, THE
PLANTS GROW FROM SEEDS PRODUCING TWO COTYLEDONS, SHOULD INSIST THAT ALL
THESE HISTORIANS RESEMBLE A BOTANIST WHO, HAVING NOTICED THAT SOME

AND ADMIT HISTORICAL EVENTS WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE THEORY.
ONCE AGAIN, AS USURPATIONS OF POWER. AND SO THESE HISTORIANS ALSO SEE
RESULTS OF THE ILL-DIRECTED WILL OF ONE OR MORE INDIVIDUALS, THAT IS,
NOT AS THE RESULTS OF FREE TRANSFERENCES OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL, BUT AS
WARS, REVOLUTIONS, AND CONQUESTS--ARE PRESENTED BY THESE HISTORIANS
PARTY LEADER. SO THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE EVENTS OF HISTORY--CIVIL
MISTAKES, ON CRAFT, OR ON THE WEAKNESS OF A DIPLOMATIST, A RULER, OR A
OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL BUT ARE ACCIDENTS DEPENDENT ON CUNNING, ON
OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT SOME OF THESE TRANSFERS ARE NOT NORMAL DELEGATIONS
OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, CONQUESTS, AND ALLIANCES, THE HISTORIANS ARE
OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO ANOTHER, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW
GOVERNMENT, AND TO NAPOLEON III. WHEN EXPLAINING THESE RAPID TRANSFERS
TO NAPOLEON AGAIN, TO CHARLES X, TO LOUIS PHILIPPE, TO A REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION, TO THE DIRECTORY, TO NAPOLEON, TO ALEXANDER, TO LOUIS XVIII,
THEN SUDDENLY DURING A PERIOD OF FIFTY YEARS IS TRANSFERRED TO THE
WILL IS NOT WITHDRAWN FROM CERTAIN RULERS AND THEIR HEIRS, AND
LITTLE DOES THIS VIEW EXPLAIN WHY FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES THE COLLECTIVE
REACTIONS? TO THESE QUESTIONS THERE ARE AND CAN BE NO ANSWERS. EQUALLY
SHOULD IT REACT JUST ON LOUIS XVI? AND WHAT IS THE TIME LIMIT FOR SUCH
LOUIS XVI. BUT WHY DID IT NOT REACT ON LOUIS XIV OR ON LOUIS XV--WHY
REPLY THAT LOUIS XIV'S ACTIVITY, CONTRARY TO THE PROGRAM, REACTED ON
AND CHARLES I ARE EXECUTED BY THEIR PEOPLE? TO THIS QUESTION HISTORIANS
XIV AND IVAN THE TERRIBLE END THEIR REIGNS TRANQUILLY, WHILE LOUIS XVI
WEALTH, FREEDOM, AND ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE PEOPLE, HOW IS IT THAT LOUIS
THEORY. IF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH POWER IS ENTRUSTED CONSIST IN THE
CONDITIONS EXISTS--THE FACTS OF HISTORY ALMOST ALWAYS CONTRADICT THAT
PROGRAM--OR EVEN ADMITTING THAT SOME ONE GENERAL PROGRAM OF THESE
TO MENTION THE HISTORIANS' CONTRADICTIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS
OR ENLIGHTENMENT OF CITIZENS OF FRANCE OR SOME OTHER COUNTRY. BUT NOT
PROGRESS, LOOKS FOR THESE CONDITIONS IN THE GREATNESS, WEALTH, FREEDOM,
EACH HISTORIAN, ACCORDING TO HIS VIEW OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A NATION'S

CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER.
CONSISTS IN THESE HISTORIANS DO NOT SAY, OR IF THEY DO THEY CONTINUALLY
PEOPLE HAS BY TACIT AGREEMENT PRESCRIBED TO THEM. BUT WHAT THIS PROGRAM
ONLY CONDITIONALLY ON CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM THAT THE WILL OF THE
OF THE PEOPLE TO THEIR RULERS, AND THAT HISTORICAL LEADERS HAVE POWER
HISTORIANS SAY THAT POWER RESTS ON A CONDITIONAL DELEGATION OF THE WILL
RECOGNIZING THE FALSITY OF THIS VIEW OF HISTORY, ANOTHER SET OF

CONTRADICTORY CAN ONLY SATISFY YOUNG CHILDREN.
EVIDENTLY THE EXPLANATIONS FURNISHED BY THESE HISTORIANS BEING MUTUALLY
REAL POWER, AND THAT ALL THE OTHERS WERE VIOLATIONS OF POWER.
PROVE: THE ONE THAT THE CONVENTION AND THE OTHER THAT THE EMPIRE WAS THE
INFRINGERS OF THE TRUE POWER, WHILE A REPUBLICAN AND A BONAPARTIST WILL
THAT THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE DIRECTORY, AND BONAPARTE WERE MERE
STRUGGLE WITH ONE ANOTHER--THAT A LEGITIMIST HISTORIAN WILL PROVE
THE LIFE OF NATIONS DURING WHICH VARIOUS POWERS ARISE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND
HAS THE INCONVENIENCE--IN APPLICATION TO COMPLEX AND STORMY PERIODS IN
THEIR THEORY, SUITABLE FOR PRIMITIVE AND PEACEFUL PERIODS OF HISTORY,

OPPOSING THIS IS NOT A POWER BUT A VIOLATION OF POWER--MERE VIOLENCE.
POWER TO BE THE ONE ABSOLUTE AND REAL POWER, AND THAT ANY OTHER FORCE
THEREFORE WHEN DESCRIBING SOME SINGLE STATE THEY ASSUME THAT PARTICULAR
THE PEOPLE IS UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED TO HISTORICAL PERSONS, AND
THE MEANING OF POWER, SEEM TO CONSIDER THAT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF
REFERRED TO--IN THEIR SIMPLICITY FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION OF
SOME HISTORIANS--THOSE BIOGRAPHICAL AND SPECIALIST HISTORIANS ALREADY

RELATION OF THE PEOPLE TO THEIR RULERS.
AND THESE ARE THE THREE WAYS IN WHICH THE HISTORIANS DO EXPLAIN THE

PEOPLE TO OTHERS.
CONDITIONS ON WHICH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS TRANSFERRED FROM SOME
FROM THE GREATER OR LESSER FULFILLMENT BY THE RULERS OF THESE UNKNOWN
OF SEVERAL AUTHORITIES, THEIR STRUGGLES AND THEIR FALLS, RESULT SOLELY
THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN AND INDEFINITE, AND THAT THE APPEARANCE
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS DELEGATED TO THE RULERS CONDITIONALLY, BUT
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEIR POWER WAS ENTRUSTED TO THEM; OR (3) THAT
DESTRUCTIONS OF POWER RESULT FROM A NONOBSERVANCE BY THE RULERS OF THE
CONDITIONS, AND TO SHOW THAT ALL LIMITATIONS, CONFLICTS, AND EVEN
IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RULERS CONDITIONALLY, UNDER DEFINITE AND KNOWN
INFRINGEMENT OF THE REAL POWER; OR (2) THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
AGAINST THE POWER ONCE APPOINTED, SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY REGARDED AS AN
THAT THEREFORE EVERY EMERGENCE OF A NEW POWER, EVERY STRUGGLE
UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE RULER OR RULERS THEY HAVE CHOSEN, AND
EITHER TO ASSUME (1) THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS ALWAYS

TO THESE QUESTIONS THREE ANSWERS ARE POSSIBLE:

FIGHT THE AUSTRIANS?
TO NAPOLEON IN 1809, WHEN OUR ARMY IN ALLIANCE WITH THE FRENCH WENT TO
TO NAPOLEON IN 1806? WAS THE WILL OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE TRANSFERRED
CONQUEROR? WAS THE WILL OF THE CONFEDERATION OF THE RHINE TRANSFERRED
RELATIONS, IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ALSO TRANSFERRED TO THEIR
PART--TRANSFER THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TO A NEW RULER? IN INTERNATIONAL
DO PALACE REVOLUTIONS--IN WHICH SOMETIMES ONLY TWO OR THREE PEOPLE TAKE

HE ARRESTED?
TAKEN PRISONER AT BOULOGNE, AND WHY, LATER ON, WERE THOSE CRIMINALS WHOM
THEN WHY WAS NAPOLEON I? WHY WAS NAPOLEON III A CRIMINAL WHEN HE WAS
RULER, WAS PUGACHEV A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE? IF NOT,
IF POWER BE THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED TO THEIR

NOTHING.
ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE MUTATIONS OF POWER IN TIME IT CAN ANSWER
POWER--EXISTING IMMUTABLY OUTSIDE TIME--IS, BUT TO HISTORY'S QUESTIONS
MINUTELY HOW IN ITS OPINION POWER SHOULD BE CONSTITUTED AND WHAT
THAT HELD BY JURISPRUDENCE, IT FOLLOWS THAT JURISPRUDENCE CAN TELL
FROM THIS FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VIEW HELD BY HISTORY AND

PHYSICS FIRE IS NOT AN ELEMENT BUT A PHENOMENON.
HISTORY, THE STATE AND POWER ARE MERELY PHENOMENA, JUST AS FOR MODERN
REGARDED FIRE--NAMELY, AS SOMETHING EXISTING ABSOLUTELY. BUT FOR
THE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCE REGARDS THE STATE AND POWER AS THE ANCIENTS

DEFINITION OF POWER NEEDS EXPLANATION.
BE ARRANGED, IT IS ALL VERY CLEAR; BUT WHEN APPLIED TO HISTORY THAT
STATE AND POWER MIGHT BE ARRANGED WERE IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL THAT TO
IN THE DOMAIN OF JURISPRUDENCE, WHICH CONSISTS OF DISCUSSIONS OF HOW A

TACIT CONSENT, TO THEIR CHOSEN RULERS.
POWER IS THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED, BY EXPRESSED OR

UNDERSTANDING OF POWER FOR TRUE GOLD.
THAT EXCHANGE BANK OF HISTORY WHICH OFFERS TO EXCHANGE HISTORY'S
AND THAT IS HOW POWER IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCE,

POWER.
ELSEWHERE--IN THE RELATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE MAN WHO WIELDS THE
QUALITIES OF HIM WHO POSSESSES IT, IT MUST EVIDENTLY BE LOOKED FOR
IF THE SOURCE OF POWER LIES NEITHER IN THE PHYSICAL NOR IN THE MORAL

RULED OVER.
CONTRARY WERE GENERALLY MORALLY WEAKER THAN ANY OF THE MILLIONS THEY
OVER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, HAD ANY PARTICULAR MORAL QUALITIES, BUT ON THE
HISTORY SHOWS US THAT NEITHER A LOUIS XI NOR A METTERNICH, WHO RULED
SUCH AS NAPOLEON ABOUT WHOSE MORAL QUALITIES OPINIONS DIFFER WIDELY,
BASED ON THE PREDOMINANCE OF MORAL STRENGTH, FOR, NOT TO MENTION HEROES
SPECIAL STRENGTH OF SOUL AND MIND CALLED GENIUS. THIS POWER CANNOT BE
LEADING FIGURES IN HISTORY ARE HEROES, THAT IS, MEN GIFTED WITH A
FORCE, AS IN THEIR SIMPLICITY SOME HISTORIANS THINK WHO SAY THAT THE
LIKE THE POWER OF HERCULES; NOR CAN IT BE BASED ON THE EFFECT OF MORAL
ONE--A DOMINATION BASED ON THE APPLICATION OR THREAT OF PHYSICAL FORCE,
IT CANNOT BE THE DIRECT PHYSICAL POWER OF A STRONG MAN OVER A WEAK

DETERMINE WHAT IS THIS POWER OF ONE MAN OVER OTHERS.
HIM BY GOD. BUT AS SOON AS WE DO NOT ADMIT THAT, IT BECOMES ESSENTIAL TO
THIS REPLY IS QUITE SATISFACTORY IF WE BELIEVE THAT THE POWER WAS GIVEN

ORDERED WAS DONE.
CERTAIN WORDS, SEEMS TO US SENSELESS. HE HAD THE POWER AND SO WHAT HE
WHY DID SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN GO TO FIGHT WHEN NAPOLEON UTTERED
ACCUSTOMED TO THAT IDEA AND HAVE BECOME SO USED TO IT THAT THE QUESTION:
NAPOLEON ORDERED AN ARMY TO BE RAISED AND GO TO WAR. WE ARE SO

SO IT IS ESSENTIAL TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS MEANT BY POWER.
A RETURN TO THE FIRST IS IMPOSSIBLE, THE BELIEF HAS BEEN DESTROYED; AND

HISTORICAL EVENTS AND TERMED "POWER."
AFFAIRS OR A DEFINITE EXPLANATION OF THE MEANING OF THE FORCE PRODUCING
TO THE FORMER BELIEF IN THE DIRECT INTERVENTION OF THE DEITY IN HUMAN
TAKE A SINGLE STEP TILL IT HAS CHOSEN ONE OF TWO THINGS: EITHER A RETURN
OF THAT MAN'S WILL TO THE DEITY, HISTORY CANNOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTIONS
SUBJECTION OF THE WILL OF A NATION TO SOME CHOSEN MAN AND THE SUBJECTION
HAVING ABANDONED THE CONCEPTION OF THE ANCIENTS AS TO THE DIVINE


CHAPTER IV





TASTE FOR WHAT THEY CALL "SERIOUS READING."
THEIR OWN, ONLY IN UNIVERSITIES AND AMONG THE MASS OF READERS WHO HAVE A
HUMANITY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION, SERVE AS CURRENCY FOR SOME PURPOSES OF
GOLD, SO UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF CULTURE, NOT ANSWERING
ACCEPT THEM AS GOLD, OR AMONG THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THE NATURE OF
OF IMITATION GOLD CAN BE USED ONLY AMONG A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO AGREE TO
CULTURE EVADE IT AND ANSWER SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT. AND AS COUNTERS
GIVE CONTRADICTORY REPLIES TO THAT QUESTION, WHILE THE HISTORIANS OF
HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION: WHAT IS POWER? THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS
SO UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WILL BE VALUABLE ONLY WHEN THEY CAN REPLY TO
GOLD ONLY IF IT IS SERVICEABLE NOT MERELY FOR EXCHANGE BUT ALSO FOR USE,
TOKENS OF BASE METAL THAT HAVE NO VALUE BUT MERELY JINGLE. AS GOLD IS
THAT. PAPER MONEY MAY DECEIVE THE IGNORANT, BUT NOBODY IS DECEIVED BY
OF GOLD. IT MAY INDEED MAKE JINGLING COIN, BUT WILL DO NO MORE THAN
SUBSTITUTE FOR IT MONEY MADE OF METAL THAT HAS NOT THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY
LIKE PEOPLE WHO, RECOGNIZING THE DEFECTS OF PAPER MONEY, DECIDE TO
THE WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORIES AND OF THE HISTORY OF CULTURE ARE

COMPREHENSION.
TO EXCHANGE THE CURRENT PAPER MONEY FOR THE REAL GOLD OF ACTUAL
SOMEONE INQUIRES: BY WHAT FORCE DID NAPOLEON DO THIS?--THAT IS, WANTS
TOO MANY OF THEM ARE WRITTEN OR BECAUSE IN HIS SIMPLICITY OF HEART
DOUBTS CONCERNING THE REAL VALUE OF SUCH HISTORIES ARISE EITHER BECAUSE
OF IT GETS MADE OR BECAUSE PEOPLE TRY TO EXCHANGE IT FOR GOLD, SO ALSO
VALUE OF PAPER MONEY ARISE EITHER BECAUSE, BEING EASY TO MAKE, TOO MUCH
PERHAPS EVEN POSSESS A TINGE OF POETRY. BUT JUST AS DOUBTS OF THE REAL
SUCH HISTORIES AS THIERS' WILL BE INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE AND MAY
YOU NEED ONLY FORGET TO ASK HOW THE WILL OF HEROES PRODUCES EVENTS, AND
ADVANTAGEOUSLY, AS LONG AS NO ONE ASKS WHAT IS THE SECURITY BEHIND THEM.
CAN CIRCULATE AND FULFILL THEIR PURPOSE WITHOUT HARM TO ANYONE AND EVEN
SPECIAL NATIONAL HISTORIES ARE LIKE PAPER MONEY. THEY CAN BE USED AND
IS LIKE MONEY IN CIRCULATION--PAPER MONEY AND COIN. THE BIOGRAPHIES AND
IN DEALING WITH HUMANITY'S INQUIRY, THE SCIENCE OF HISTORY UP TO NOW

EVERY STEP.
PROFESSEDLY REJECT THAT CONCEPTION BUT INEVITABLY HAVE RECOURSE TO IT AT
THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF CULTURE THEMSELVES, FOR THEY
POWER AS AN EXPLANATION OF HISTORICAL EVENTS IS BEST DEMONSTRATED BY
POSSIBLE WAY OF DEALING WITH IT. THE NECESSITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF
OF TREATING HISTORICAL MATERIAL, MERELY DEPRIVES HIMSELF OF THE ONE
BREAKS THAT HANDLE OFF, AS BUCKLE DID, WITHOUT FINDING SOME OTHER METHOD
HISTORY, AS AT PRESENT EXPOUNDED, CAN BE DEALT WITH, AND ANYONE WHO
THIS CONCEPTION IS THE ONE HANDLE BY MEANS OF WHICH THE MATERIAL OF

AND THE ONLY SUCH CONCEPTION KNOWN TO HISTORIANS IS THAT OF POWER.
OF A FORCE COMPELLING MEN TO DIRECT THEIR ACTIVITY TOWARD A CERTAIN END.
IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE MOVEMENT OF HUMANITY WITHOUT THE CONCEPTION
OF ALL, ABSOLUTELY ALL THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN AN EVENT, IT IS QUITE
CAESARS, ALEXANDERS, LUTHERS, OR VOLTAIRES, AND NOT THE HISTORIES
SO LONG AS HISTORIES ARE WRITTEN OF SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS, WHETHER

AS AN INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCE, LIKE THE SMOKE THAT IS BLOWN AWAY.
FROM SEVERAL OTHER FORCES, LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHEELS; OTHERS AGAIN
PEASANT SEES THE DEVIL IN THE LOCOMOTIVE; OTHERS AS A FORCE RESULTING
OBSERVED. SOME SEE IT AS A FORCE DIRECTLY INHERENT IN HEROES, AS THE
DIFFERENT KINDS, ALL OF WHICH ARE INCOMMENSURATE WITH THE MOVEMENT
YET TO SUPPLY THIS CONCEPTION VARIOUS HISTORIANS TAKE FORCES OF

OF SOME FORCE COMMENSURATE WITH THE WHOLE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLES.
THE ONLY CONCEPTION THAT CAN EXPLAIN THE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLES IS THAT

THAT OF A FORCE COMMENSURATE WITH THE MOVEMENT OBSERVED.
THE ONLY CONCEPTION THAT CAN EXPLAIN THE MOVEMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE IS

EXPLANATION.
FIRST SIGN THAT OCCURS TO HIM AND IN HIS TURN HAS OFFERED THAT AS AN
NOTICED THAT THE WHEELS DO NOT SUPPLY AN EXPLANATION AND HAS TAKEN THE
THE MOVEMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE BY THE SMOKE THAT IS CARRIED BACK HAS
HAS NO RIGHT TO STOP IN HIS SEARCH FOR THE CAUSE. THE MAN WHO EXPLAINS
MOVEMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE IN THE PRESSURE OF STEAM IN THE BOILER, HE
THE WHEELS GO ROUND; AND TILL HE HAS REACHED THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF THE
HAVING ONCE BEGUN TO ANALYZE HE OUGHT TO GO ON AND EXPLAIN FURTHER WHY
SAYS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHEELS IS THE CAUSE REFUTES HIMSELF, FOR
CONTRADICTION, WILL THEY SEE THAT THEY ARE BOTH WRONG. BUT THE MAN WHO
BUT A GERMAN, WHO MOVES THE LOCOMOTIVE. ONLY THEN, AS A RESULT OF THE
OR ANOTHER PEASANT WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE DEVIL
REFUTE HIM SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO PROVE TO HIM THAT THERE IS NO DEVIL,
THE PEASANT IS IRREFUTABLE. HE HAS DEVISED A COMPLETE EXPLANATION. TO

THE SMOKE WHICH THE WIND CARRIES AWAY.
WHEELS GO ROUND. A THIRD ASSERTS THAT THE CAUSE OF ITS MOVEMENT LIES IN
THE DEVIL MOVES IT. ANOTHER MAN SAYS THE LOCOMOTIVE MOVES BECAUSE ITS
A LOCOMOTIVE IS MOVING. SOMEONE ASKS: "WHAT MOVES IT?" A PEASANT SAYS


CHAPTER III





POWER WHICH THEY APPARENTLY DO NOT RECOGNIZE.
IN HISTORY, AND THAT HISTORY CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY INTRODUCING A
THAT THE NEW FORCE THEY HAVE DEVISED DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENS
THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE INVOLUNTARILY CONTRADICT THEMSELVES, AND SHOW
SAY PLAINLY THAT THAT WAS THE RESULT OF NAPOLEON'S WILL. SPEAKING SO,
INVOLUNTARILY DESCRIBE IT AS RESULTING FROM AN EXERCISE OF POWER--AND
ACTUAL HISTORIC EVENT SUCH AS THE CAMPAIGN OF 1812 FOR INSTANCE, THEY
DOCTRINES AS CAUSES OF EVENTS, AS SOON AS THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE AN
AND MINUTELY EXAMINING VARIOUS RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHIC, AND POLITICAL
TO APPROXIMATE, ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM THE FACT THAT AFTER SERIOUSLY
HISTORIES OF CULTURE, TO WHICH ALL GENERAL HISTORIES TEND MORE AND MORE
(WHICH MAY POSSIBLY EVEN BE OF USE TO SOMEONE FOR SOMETHING) THE
BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE INTRINSIC QUALITY OF HISTORIES OF THIS KIND

THEORY.
DEFINITE MEANING, AND WHICH CAN THEREFORE BE READILY INTRODUCED INTO ANY
UNDER WHOSE BANNER IT IS VERY EASY TO USE WORDS HAVING A STILL LESS
CIVILIZATION, CULTURE, IDEAS, ARE ALL INDISTINCT, INDEFINITE CONCEPTIONS
DO NOT WRITE HISTORY), AND (2) THAT SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY, ENLIGHTENMENT,
(IF THEY DO NOT EXPRESS IT, THAT IS MERELY BECAUSE TRADERS AND SOLDIERS
BELIEF IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE TO TRADERS, AGRICULTURISTS, AND SOLDIERS
SUPPLIES THE BASIS OF THE MOVEMENT OF ALL HUMANITY, JUST AS A SIMILAR
NATURAL AND AGREEABLE FOR THEM TO THINK THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THEIR CLASS
A CONCLUSION: (1) THAT HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY LEARNED MEN, AND SO IT IS
ONLY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HAVE LED THE HISTORIANS TO SUCH
EXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND.
ACTIVITY IS CONSIDERED BY THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE TO BE THE CAUSE OR
HANDICRAFT, GARDENING, OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE. BUT WHY INTELLECTUAL
CONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCE,
ACTIVITY OF MEN AND THEIR HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS, JUST AS SUCH A
AND SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INTELLECTUAL
UNDOUBTEDLY SOME RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN ALL WHO LIVE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY,

EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSAL NEXUS OF THIS NEW FORCE WITH THE EVENT.
FRENCHMEN BEGIN TO DROWN ONE ANOTHER CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT AN
OF AN EVENT; BUT HOW A BOOK, LE CONTRAT SOCIAL, HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING
EVEN CONCEIVE THAT NAPOLEON TOGETHER WITH OTHER INFLUENCES WAS THE CAUSE
THAT NAPOLEON HAD POWER AND SO EVENTS OCCURRED; WITH SOME EFFORT ONE MAY
WHICH WITH THE MASSES NEEDS EXPLANATION. IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND
HISTORIANS, ANOTHER, NEWER FORCE--THE IDEA--IS ADDED, THE CONNECTION OF
INFLUENCE OF ADVISERS AND OTHER PEOPLE INTRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSAL
REMAINS UNANSWERED, AND TO THE FORMER POWER OF MONARCHS AND TO THE
SOME UNDEFINED FORCE CALLED AN IDEA--HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION STILL
WHICH THESE HISTORIES ARE FILLED--ADMITTING THAT NATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY
BUT EVEN ADMITTING AS CORRECT ALL THE CUNNINGLY DEVISED ARGUMENTS WITH

EXECUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE PREACHING OF LOVE.
FROM THE DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF MAN, OR THE VERY CRUEL WARS AND
SUCH FACTS AS THE VERY CRUEL MURDERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION RESULTING
ACTIVITY CONTROLS PEOPLE'S ACTIONS, FOR THAT VIEW IS NOT CONFIRMED BY
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES, AND IN NO CASE CAN ONE ADMIT THAT INTELLECTUAL
THAT THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND THE
LIES IN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY, ONLY BY A GREAT STRETCH CAN ONE ADMIT
THE CAUSE. BUT DESPITE THEIR ENDEAVORS TO PROVE THAT THE CAUSE OF EVENTS
THE INDICATION OF INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND SAY THAT THIS INDICATION IS
INDICATIONS ACCOMPANYING EVERY VITAL PHENOMENON, THESE HISTORIANS SELECT
SUCH AND SUCH PEOPLE WROTE SUCH AND SUCH BOOKS? OF THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF
ANOTHER IN SUCH AND SUCH WAYS, WHY NOT EXPLAIN THEM BY THE FACT THAT
EVENTS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS TREATED ONE
PROGENITORS, THE WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORIES, FOR IF HISTORICAL
THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE ARE QUITE CONSISTENT IN REGARD TO THEIR

CALLED CULTURE--IN MENTAL ACTIVITY.
TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT. THEY SEE IT IN WHAT IS
SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS--AGAIN
CULTURE--FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO
A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS--THE SO-CALLED HISTORIANS OF

WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING ELSE, SAY THAT POWER PRODUCES EVENTS.
THEIR THEORY, SAY THAT POWER IS THE RESULT OF EVENTS, AND SOMETIMES,
UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS SOMETIMES, WHEN IT PLEASES THEM AND FITS IN WITH
AWAY," OR, "THE WIND HAS BROUGHT UP THE CLOUDS." AND IN THE SAME WAY THE
WHETHER THEY WANT RAIN OR FINE WEATHER: "THE WIND HAS BLOWN THE CLOUDS
PEASANTS HAVING NO CLEAR IDEA OF THE CAUSE OF RAIN, SAY, ACCORDING TO

CONTRADICT THE SPECIALIST HISTORIANS BUT CONTRADICT THEMSELVES.
JUST WHAT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS DO, AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY NOT ONLY
HAS TO ADMIT AN UNEXPLAINED FORCE ACTING ON THE RESULTANT. AND THAT IS
DENIED--AND TO RECOGNIZE IT AS THE RESULTANT OF THE FORCES, THAT IS, HE
HISTORIAN IS AGAIN OBLIGED TO FALL BACK ON POWER--THE FORCE HE HAD
FORCES EQUAL TO ONE A GAVE A RESULTANT EQUAL TO A THOUSAND TIMES A--THE
THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RESULTED--THAT IS, HOW COMPONENT
OF MILLIONS. AND THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN HOW FROM THESE RELATIONS OF THEIRS
AFFECTED THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONS BUT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SUBMISSION
MADAME DE STAEL, AND OTHERS SPOKE CERTAIN WORDS TO ONE ANOTHER ONLY
OF MILLIONS OF FRENCHMEN SUBMITTING TO THE BOURBONS. THAT CHATEAUBRIAND,
OTHERS, EVIDENTLY DOES NOT EQUAL THE RESULTANT, NAMELY THE PHENOMENON
THE INTERACTIONS OF CHATEAUBRIAND, TALLEYRAND, MADAME DE STAEL, AND THE
CHATEAUBRIAND, AND THE REST--BUT THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS, THAT IS,
EVIDENTLY DECOMPOSES ALEXANDER'S POWER INTO THE COMPONENTS: TALLEYRAND,
DE STAEL, TALLEYRAND, FICHTE CHATEAUBRIAND, AND OTHERS. THE HISTORIAN
ALEXANDER'S WILL--SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF STEIN, METTERNICH, MADAME
1813 AND THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS WERE DUE TO OTHER THINGS BESIDE
OPINION OF THE SPECIALIST HISTORIAN, TRIES TO PROVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF
WILL OF ALEXANDER. BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIAN GERVINUS, REFUTING THIS
OF THE BOURBONS PLAINLY ASSERT THAT THESE EVENTS WERE PRODUCED BY THE
SPECIALIST HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CAMPAIGN OF 1813 OR THE RESTORATION

COMPONENTS, ANOTHER UNEXPLAINED FORCE AFFECTING THE RESULTANT ACTION.
FORCES THEY ARE OBLIGED TO ADMIT, IN ADDITION TO THE INSUFFICIENT
OBSERVED BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS, AND SO TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTANT
SUM OF THE COMPONENTS MUST EQUAL THE RESULTANT. THIS CONDITION IS NEVER
TO FIND COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO THE COMPOSITE OR RESULTANT FORCE, THE

ENTERING THE FIELD OF ANALYSIS THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STOP HALFWAY.
A CHAIN OF SUCH CONTRADICTIONS. THIS CONTRADICTION OCCURS BECAUSE AFTER
EVERY STEP, BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS' ACCOUNTS ARE ALL MADE UP OF
THIS CURIOUS CONTRADICTION IS NOT ACCIDENTAL. NOT ONLY DOES IT OCCUR AT

THE AGE.
POWER SUPPRESSED THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF
GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE PRODUCED NAPOLEON'S POWER. BUT NAPOLEON'S
DEVELOPMENT BY NAPOLEON'S CAPRICE. THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE
MISDIRECTED WILL, AND THAT THE VERY IDEAS OF 1789 WERE ARRESTED IN THEIR
AND OTHER THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE WERE SIMPLY THE PRODUCT OF NAPOLEON'S
1789 AND SO FORTH, AND AT ANOTHER PLAINLY SAY THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF 1812
TIME PROVE NAPOLEON TO BE A PRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION, OF THE IDEAS OF
PRODUCING EVENTS. GERVINUS, SCHLOSSER, AND OTHERS, FOR INSTANCE, AT ONE
THE RESULTANT OF VARIOUS FORCES, AND THEN HIS POWER IS ITSELF A FORCE
HISTORIC CHARACTER IS FIRST THE PRODUCT OF HIS TIME, AND HIS POWER ONLY
PRODUCES EVENTS, AND TREAT IT AS THEIR CAUSE. IN THEIR EXPOSITION, AN
HISTORIANS STILL EMPLOY THE CONCEPTION OF POWER AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF
AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS. YET IN MOST CASES UNIVERSAL
AS THE PRODUCT OF MANY FORCES, CAN NO LONGER, IT WOULD SEEM, BE REGARDED
ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE POWER OF HISTORICAL PERSONAGES, REPRESENTED

EVENT.
OF ONE MAN, BUT IN THE INTERACTION OF MANY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THE
GENERAL HISTORIAN LOOKS FOR THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT NOT IN THE POWER
DIRECTED FORCES. IN DESCRIBING A WAR OR THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE, A
HEROES AND RULERS, BUT AS THE RESULTANT OF A MULTIPLICITY OF VARIOUSLY
WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS. THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS A POWER INHERENT IN
RECOGNIZE HOW ERRONEOUS IS THE SPECIALIST HISTORIANS' VIEW OF THE FORCE
WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY WHO DEAL WITH ALL THE NATIONS SEEM TO

REPLY TO HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION.
THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS, AND FURNISH NO
OF THIS CLASS, BY MUTUALLY DESTROYING ONE ANOTHER'S POSITIONS, DESTROY
WAS BASED ON HIS TRICKERY AND DECEPTION OF THE PEOPLE. SO THE HISTORIANS
POWER WAS BASED ON HIS VIRTUE AND GENIUS. LANFREY, A REPUBLICAN, SAYS IT
PARTICULAR PERSON WAS BASED. THIERS, A BONAPARTIST, SAYS THAT NAPOLEON'S
IN THEIR STATEMENT AS TO THE FORCE ON WHICH THE AUTHORITY OF SOME
BESIDES THIS, HISTORIANS OF THAT KIND CONTRADICT EACH OTHER EVEN
ALEXANDER'S, A THIRD THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE POWER OF SOME OTHER PERSON.
EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER, ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY
BUT OFTEN IN QUITE CONTRADICTORY WAYS. ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT AN
MEANING, FOR THIS FORCE IS UNDERSTOOD BY THEM ALL NOT ONLY DIFFERENTLY
TO DESCRIBE THE SAME EVENT, THE REPLIES THEY GIVE IMMEDIATELY LOSE ALL
AS SOON AS HISTORIANS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES AND TENDENCIES BEGIN
SATISFACTORY ONLY AS LONG AS THERE IS BUT ONE HISTORIAN TO EACH EVENT.
OF HISTORIAN TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT FORCE CAUSES EVENTS TO HAPPEN ARE
GENERAL OF THE PERSONS THEY DESCRIBE. THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THIS KIND
EVENTS OCCUR SOLELY BY THE WILL OF A NAPOLEON, AND ALEXANDER, OR IN
THIS FORCE AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS. IN THEIR NARRATION
BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF SEPARATE NATIONS UNDERSTAND

WHAT FORCE MOVES THE NATIONS?


CHAPTER II





QUITE WELL KNOWN TO EVERYBODY.
FORCE, SO VARIOUSLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE HISTORIANS THEMSELVES, IS REALLY
READING MANY HISTORICAL WORKS CANNOT HELP DOUBTING WHETHER THIS NEW
EVERYONE. BUT IN SPITE OF EVERY DESIRE TO REGARD IT AS KNOWN, ANYONE
HISTORY SEEMS TO ASSUME THAT THIS FORCE IS SELF-EVIDENT AND KNOWN TO

HISTORY LIES PRECISELY IN THAT FORCE.
BE EXPLAINED IN WHAT THIS NEW FORCE CONSISTS, FOR THE WHOLE INTEREST OF
IF INSTEAD OF A DIVINE POWER SOME OTHER FORCE HAS APPEARED, IT SHOULD

AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONS.
AUTHORS, WE OUGHT TO BE SHOWN THE CONNECTION EXISTING BETWEEN THESE MEN
A POWER, AND THEREFORE BEFORE SPEAKING ABOUT NAPOLEONS, LOUIS-ES, AND
THROUGH NAPOLEONS, LOUIS-ES, AND WRITERS; BUT WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH
POWER BASED ON ITSELF AND ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY DIRECTING ITS NATIONS
WHAT WAS ASKED. ALL THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF WE RECOGNIZED A DIVINE
ALL THAT MAY BE SO AND MANKIND IS READY TO AGREE WITH IT, BUT IT IS NOT

PROUD, OR THAT CERTAIN WRITERS WROTE CERTAIN BOOKS.
EITHER THAT NAPOLEON WAS A GREAT GENIUS, OR THAT LOUIS XIV WAS VERY
POWER THAT MOVES PEOPLES? TO THIS, MODERN HISTORY LABORIOUSLY REPLIES
REPLY TO WHICH ALL THE REST WILL BE INCOMPREHENSIBLE--IS: WHAT IS THE
HUMANITY AND OF THE PEOPLES, THE FIRST QUESTION--IN THE ABSENCE OF A
IF THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY BE TO GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF

MODERN HISTORY, LIKE A DEAF MAN, ANSWERS QUESTIONS NO ONE HAS ASKED.
THE STRANGENESS AND ABSURDITY OF THESE REPLIES ARISE FROM THE FACT THAT

HISTORIES OF THE CULTURE OF THAT PERIOD.
OF SEPARATE STATES TO THE WRITERS OF GENERAL HISTORIES AND THE NEW
HISTORIANS GIVE, FROM THE COMPILERS OF MEMOIRS AND THE HISTORIES
THE CONTRADICTORY REPLIES, NOT MEETING THE QUESTIONS, WHICH ALL THE
HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS. ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A VERY MILD EXPRESSION OF
IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THIS IS IRONIC--A CARICATURE OF THE

SUBJECTS."
OCCURRED AND THE SOVEREIGNS ONCE AGAIN ALL BEGAN TO OPPRESS THEIR
BEQUEATHED HIS GREAT DEEDS TO POSTERITY. BUT IN EUROPE A REACTION
FRANCE SO DEAR TO HIS HEART, DIED A LINGERING DEATH ON THAT ROCK AND
TO THE ISLAND OF ST. HELENA. AND THE EXILE, SEPARATED FROM THE BELOVED
THE GENIUS NAPOLEON AND, SUDDENLY RECOGNIZING HIM AS A BRIGAND, SENT HIM
ANGRY AT THIS AND WENT TO FIGHT THE FRENCH ONCE MORE. AND THEY DEFEATED
HIM, IMMEDIATELY ALL SUBMITTED TO HIM. BUT THE ALLIED MONARCHS WERE
ARRIVED IN FRANCE WITH A BATTALION, AND THE FRENCH, WHO HAD BEEN HATING
AGAIN ORDERING THEIR ARMIES TO KILL ONE ANOTHER, BUT JUST THEN NAPOLEON
DIPLOMATISTS AND MONARCHS NEARLY QUARRELED AND WERE ON THE POINT OF
THESE CONVERSATIONS MADE THE NATIONS HAPPY OR UNHAPPY. SUDDENLY THE
THEREBY EXTENDED THE FRONTIERS OF FRANCE) TALKED IN VIENNA AND BY
MANAGED TO SIT DOWN IN A PARTICULAR CHAIR BEFORE ANYONE ELSE AND
THE SKILLFUL STATESMEN AND DIPLOMATISTS (ESPECIALLY TALLEYRAND, WHO
BEFORE HIS OLD GUARDS, RENOUNCED THE THRONE AND WENT INTO EXILE. THEN
FRENCH AND THE ALLIES, BEGAN TO REIGN. AND NAPOLEON, SHEDDING TEARS

ABDICATE, AND SENT HIM TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA, NOT DEPRIVING HIM OF THE
RAISED. THE ALLIES DEFEATED NAPOLEON, ENTERED PARIS, FORCED NAPOLEON TO
BECAME HIS ENEMIES AND THEIR FORCES ADVANCED AGAINST THE FRESH FORCES HE
ARM AGAINST THE DISTURBER OF ITS PEACE. ALL NAPOLEON'S ALLIES SUDDENLY
ALEXANDER, HELPED BY THE ADVICE OF STEIN AND OTHERS, UNITED EUROPE TO
MOSCOW; THEN HE SUDDENLY RAN AWAY FROM MOSCOW, AND THE EMPEROR
PEOPLE. NAPOLEON LED SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN INTO RUSSIA AND CAPTURED
WITH HIM, BUT IN 1811 THEY AGAIN QUARRELED AND AGAIN BEGAN KILLING MANY
THEREFORE FOUGHT AGAINST NAPOLEON. IN 1807 HE SUDDENLY MADE FRIENDS
WAS AN EMPEROR, ALEXANDER, WHO DECIDED TO RESTORE ORDER IN EUROPE AND
AND PRUSSIA. AND THERE TOO HE KILLED A GREAT MANY. IN RUSSIA THERE
BECOME AN EMPEROR HE AGAIN WENT OUT TO KILL PEOPLE IN ITALY, AUSTRIA,
FRANCE HE ORDERED EVERYBODY TO OBEY HIM, AND THEY ALL OBEYED HIM. HAVING
KILLED THEM SO WELL AND WAS SO CUNNING AND WISE THAT WHEN HE RETURNED TO
HE WAS A GREAT GENIUS. AND FOR SOME REASON HE WENT TO KILL AFRICANS, AND
CONQUERED EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE--THAT IS, HE KILLED MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE
PEOPLE. AT THAT TIME THERE WAS IN FRANCE A MAN OF GENIUS--NAPOLEON. HE
TO SLASH AT AND DROWN ONE ANOTHER. THEY KILLED THE KING AND MANY OTHER
MEN BEING FREE AND EQUAL. THIS CAUSED PEOPLE ALL OVER FRANCE TO BEGIN
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF DOZEN MEN IN PARIS WHO BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT ALL
MEN WROTE SOME BOOKS AT THAT TIME. AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
SUCH AND SUCH FAVORITES AND SUCH AND SUCH MISTRESSES. MOREOVER, CERTAIN
DESCENDANTS WERE WEAK MEN AND THEY TOO RULED FRANCE BADLY. AND THEY HAD
MISTRESSES AND SUCH AND SUCH MINISTERS AND HE RULED FRANCE BADLY. HIS
"LOUIS XIV WAS A VERY PROUD AND SELF-CONFIDENT MAN; HE HAD SUCH AND SUCH

EVENTS? THEN LISTEN:
THIS MOVEMENT MEANS, WHAT CAUSED IT, AND WHAT FORCE PRODUCED THESE
MODERN HISTORY REPLYING TO THESE QUESTIONS SAYS: YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT

IN HUMAN AFFAIRS, AND THEREFORE HISTORY OUGHT TO GIVE OTHER ANSWERS.
CONCEPTION OF THE ANCIENTS AS TO THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF THE DEITY
BUT MODERN HISTORY CANNOT GIVE THAT REPLY. SCIENCE DOES NOT ADMIT THE

PERIOD, NOR WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CONTRADICTIONS.
IT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING UNINTELLIGIBLE IN THE HISTORY OF THAT
IN THE DIVINE SIGNIFICANCE OF NAPOLEON, BUT FOR ANYONE BELIEVING IN
WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR AND COMPLETE. ONE MIGHT BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE
DIRECTED HIS WILL TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THE DIVINE ENDS, AND THAT REPLY,
SAID THAT GOD, TO REWARD OR PUNISH HIS PEOPLE, GAVE NAPOLEON POWER AND
IF HISTORY HAD RETAINED THE CONCEPTION OF THE ANCIENTS IT WOULD HAVE

THEMSELVES.
SCIENCE OF HISTORY, WHOSE AIM IS TO ENABLE NATIONS AND HUMANITY TO KNOW
FOR A REPLY TO THESE QUESTIONS THE COMMON SENSE OF MANKIND TURNS TO THE

MONUMENTS AND TRADITION OF THAT PERIOD.
MOST LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS HUMANITY ASKS ITSELF WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS THE
WHAT FORCE MADE MEN ACT SO? THESE ARE THE INSTINCTIVE, PLAIN, AND
HOUSES AND SLAY THEIR FELLOW MEN? WHAT WERE THE CAUSES OF THESE EVENTS?
WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN? WHY DID IT HAPPEN? WHAT MADE THOSE PEOPLE BURN

EASTWARD AND COLLIDES WITH A COUNTERMOVEMENT FROM THE EAST WESTWARD.
BY A MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES FROM WEST TO EAST. SEVERAL TIMES IT MOVES

DANDLING HIM. A BLISSFUL BRIGHT SMILE WAS FIXED ON THE BABY'S BROAD FACE
HOLDING HIS BABY SON, WHO WAS AGAIN AWAKE, ON HIS HUGE RIGHT PALM AND
WHEN NICHOLAS AND HIS WIFE CAME TO LOOK FOR PIERRE HE WAS IN THE NURSERY

THEIR ROOMS.
"COME, COME!" SHE SAID, NOT LETTING GO OF HIS ARM. AND THEY WENT TO

"YOU ARE WELL?"

COULD SEE WHAT I WAS LIKE WITHOUT YOU, HOW I SUFFERED!"
"ALL RIGHT NOW. COME ALONG! I WONDER YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED! IF ONLY YOU

"I COULD NOT, ON MY HONOR. BUT HOW IS PETYA?"

FRIGHTENED FACE AND BENT DOWN.
TO SMILE BUT DARED NOT EVEN THINK OF DOING SO. HE MADE A PITEOUS,
ABOVE ALL HE KNEW THAT HE HIMSELF WAS BRIGHT AND HAPPY. HE WANTED
KNEW THIS OUTBURST WAS UNSEEMLY AND WOULD BLOW OVER IN A MINUTE OR TWO;
PIERRE KNEW HE WAS NOT TO BLAME, FOR HE COULD NOT HAVE COME SOONER; HE

DEATH'S DOOR. BUT YOU WERE ENJOYING YOURSELF. YES, ENJOYING..."
FOR THE CHILDREN. I AM NURSING AND MY MILK WAS SPOILED.... PETYA WAS AT
TIME.... BUT WHAT ABOUT ME? YOU MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE SHOWN CONSIDERATION
"YES, IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU. YOU ARE PLEASED, YOU'VE HAD A GOOD

REPROACHES AND ANGRY WORDS.
FACE VANISHED; SHE FROWNED AND OVERWHELMED PIERRE WITH A TORRENT OF
EXPERIENCED FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT, AND THE JOY THAT HAD LIT UP HER
THEN ALL AT ONCE SHE REMEMBERED THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE SHE HAD

COVERED WITH HOARFROST. "YES, IT IS HE, HAPPY AND CONTENTED..."
BREAST, AND THEN PUSHED HIM BACK AND GAZED AT HIS RUDDY, HAPPY FACE,
TO HERSELF, AND RUSHING AT HIM EMBRACED HIM, PRESSED HIS HEAD TO HER
UNWINDING HIS SCARF. "IT'S HE! IT'S REALLY HE! HE HAS COME!" SHE SAID
ON REACHING THE VESTIBULE NATASHA SAW A TALL FIGURE IN A FUR COAT

WAS DELIGHTED THAT PIERRE, WHOM HE DID NOT MUCH CARE FOR, HAD RETURNED.
"HE'S COME!" SHE EXCLAIMED AS SHE RAN PAST, AND DENISOV FELT THAT HE TOO

BRILLIANT, JOYFUL LIGHT POURED FROM HER TRANSFIGURED FACE.
PIPE, NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME RECOGNIZED THE OLD NATASHA. A FLOOD OF
DENISOV, WHO HAD COME OUT OF THE STUDY INTO THE DANCING ROOM WITH HIS

NATASHA RAN WITH LIGHT FOOTSTEPS TO THE ANTEROOM.

FAMILIARITY THAT GROWS UP BETWEEN A NURSE AND HER MISTRESS.
"GO, MA'AM! DON'T WORRY, GO!" SHE WHISPERED, SMILING, WITH THE KIND OF

RAISED ELBOWS WAS LIFTING THE INFANT OVER THE RAIL OF HIS COT.
HER JOY LEFT THE CHILD TOO SOON, AND SHE GLANCED ROUND. THE NURSE WITH
DOOR SHE STOPPED AS IF HER CONSCIENCE REPROACHED HER FOR HAVING IN
HIM TO THE NURSE, AND WENT WITH RAPID STEPS TOWARD THE DOOR. BUT AT THE
CAUTIOUSLY WITHDRAWING HER BREAST, NATASHA ROCKED HIM A LITTLE, HANDED

SMACKED HIS LIPS.
LOOKED AT HER. "YOU'RE HERE?" HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING, AND AGAIN LAZILY
SHE COULD NOT JUMP UP AND RUN OUT. THE BABY AGAIN OPENED HIS EYES AND
THE BLOOD RUSHED TO NATASHA'S FACE AND HER FEET INVOLUNTARILY MOVED, BUT

"HE'S COME, MA'AM," WHISPERED THE NURSE.

SHE SHOULD ROUSE THE DOZING BABY.
"HAS HE COME?" NATASHA ASKED QUICKLY IN A WHISPER, AFRAID TO MOVE LEST

FACE.
MISTRESS--ENTERED THE ROOM INAUDIBLY BUT HURRIEDLY AND WITH A BEAMING
AT THE FRONT DOOR, AND THE OLD NURSE--KNOWING HOW TO PLEASE HER
SHE WAS NURSING HER BOY WHEN THE SOUND OF PIERRE'S SLEIGH WAS HEARD

HUSBAND MORE EASILY.
WHAT SHE NEEDED. WHILE ATTENDING TO HIM SHE BORE THE ANXIETY ABOUT HER
HE FELL ILL. SHE WAS TERRIFIED BY HIS ILLNESS, AND YET THAT WAS JUST
COMFORT SO OFTEN, AND FUSSED OVER HIM SO MUCH, THAT SHE OVERFED HIM AND
DURING THAT FORTNIGHT OF ANXIETY NATASHA RESORTED TO THE BABY FOR

THAT WAS UNANSWERABLE. IT WAS MORE THAN TRUE.
LIKE TO PAY HIM OUT, YOU ARE AFRAID--BUT HERE AM I! AND I AM HE..." AND
NOSE. THAT CREATURE SAID: "YOU ARE ANGRY, YOU ARE JEALOUS, YOU WOULD
CONSCIOUS OF THE MOVEMENT OF HIS LIPS AND THE SNUFFLING OF HIS LITTLE
LITTLE THREE-MONTH-OLD CREATURE WHEN HE LAY AT HER BREAST AND SHE WAS
ELSE COULD TELL HER ANYTHING SO COMFORTING OR SO REASONABLE AS THIS
AND SHE WOULD GO TO THE NURSERY TO NURSE PETYA, HER ONLY BOY. NO ONE

IN THE IMMENSE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH SHE FIRMLY BELIEVED.
AND ALL THOSE IDIOTIC SOCIETIES!" NATASHA DECLARED OF THE VERY AFFAIRS
"IT'S ALL NONSENSE, ALL RUBBISH--THOSE DISCUSSIONS WHICH LEAD TO NOTHING

TRIED TO EXCUSE PIERRE AND SUGGESTED REASONS FOR HIS DELAY IN RETURNING.

BEFORE, NATASHA HAD BEEN IN A CONSTANT STATE OF ALARM, DEPRESSION, AND
EVER SINCE THAT LEAVE OF ABSENCE HAD EXPIRED, MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT

HE WAS GIVEN FOUR WEEKS' LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

MYSTERIOUS REFLECTION.
AND THIS WAS NOT THE RESULT OF LOGICAL REASONING BUT WAS A DIRECT AND
HIM WAS REFLECTED IN HIS WIFE, ALL THAT WAS NOT QUITE GOOD WAS REJECTED.
INEXTRICABLY MINGLED AND OVERLAPPING. BUT ONLY WHAT WAS REALLY GOOD IN
HIMSELF REFLECTED IN HIS WIFE. HE FELT THE GOOD AND BAD WITHIN HIMSELF
CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS NOT A BAD MAN, AND HE FELT THIS BECAUSE HE SAW
AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF MARRIAGE PIERRE HAD THE JOYOUS AND FIRM

OPINION.
THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DISPUTE HE HAD ADDED WHEN EXPRESSING HIS
AGAINST WHICH SHE HAD ARGUED, BUT DIVESTED OF EVERYTHING SUPERFLUOUS
DELIGHT WOULD FIND IN HIS WIFE'S IDEAS AND ACTIONS THE VERY THOUGHT
WOULD HAVE A DISPUTE, BUT LONG AFTERWARDS PIERRE TO HIS SURPRISE AND
IT VERY OFTEN HAPPENED THAT IN A MOMENT OF IRRITATION HUSBAND AND WIFE

ON HAVING HER OWN WAY, AND AFTER THAT NURSED ALL HER BABIES HERSELF.
HERSELF, A THING THEN UNHEARD OF AND CONSIDERED INJURIOUS--SHE INSISTED
HIMSELF--WHO WERE ALL VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO HER NURSING HER BABY
THE OPPOSITION OF HER MOTHER, THE DOCTORS, AND EVEN OF HER HUSBAND
NURSE IS UNNATURAL AND HARMFUL. WHEN HER NEXT BABY WAS BORN, DESPITE
OF ROUSSEAU'S VIEW, WITH WHICH HE QUITE AGREED, THAT TO HAVE A WET
THREE TIMES AND NATASHA FELL ILL FROM DESPAIR, PIERRE ONE DAY TOLD HER
FIRST CHILD WHO WAS DELICATE, WHEN THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE WET NURSE
THUS IN A TIME OF TROUBLE EVER MEMORABLE TO HIM AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR

CHANGE HIS MIND SHE WOULD FIGHT HIM WITH HIS OWN WEAPONS.
ARRIVED AT THEM CLUNG TO THEM TENACIOUSLY. WHEN PIERRE HIMSELF WANTED TO
DEDUCED THE ESSENTIALS OF HIS WISHES QUITE CORRECTLY, AND HAVING ONCE
THOUGHTS HE EXPRESSED IN CONVERSATION SUPPOSED HIS WISHES TO BE. AND SHE
WITH REGARD TO PIERRE'S EXPRESSED WISHES, BUT TO WHAT NATASHA FROM THE
OCCUPATIONS, THE CHILDREN'S UPBRINGING, WERE ALL SELECTED NOT MERELY
LIFE AND PLACE OF RESIDENCE, THEIR ACQUAINTANCES AND TIES, NATASHA'S
THAT IS, BY HIS WISHES WHICH NATASHA TRIED TO GUESS. THEIR WAY OF
THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD WAS GOVERNED ACCORDING TO PIERRE'S SUPPOSED ORDERS,

EXPRESS A WISH AND NATASHA WOULD JUMP UP AND RUN TO FULFILL IT.
FOR ANYTHING TO GET JUST WHAT HE LIKED DONE ALWAYS. HE HAD ONLY TO
WAS READING OR WRITING IN HIS STUDY. PIERRE HAD BUT TO SHOW A PARTIALITY
AND THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WENT ON TIPTOE WHEN HE WAS OCCUPIED--THAT IS,
HOME NATASHA PLACED HERSELF IN THE POSITION OF A SLAVE TO HER HUSBAND,
REGULATE HIS LIFE AND THAT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY EXACTLY AS HE CHOSE. AT
IMPORTANCE. TO MAKE UP FOR THIS, AT HOME PIERRE HAD THE RIGHT TO
SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND BUT TO WHICH SHE ATTRIBUTED GREAT
BUSINESS--IN WHICH HIS WIFE INCLUDED HIS INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS, WHICH
WHIM, AND DID NOT DARE ABSENT HIMSELF FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME, EXCEPT ON
NOT DARE DINE AT THE CLUB AS A PASTIME, DID NOT DARE SPEND MONEY ON A
FLIRT WITH, BUT DARED NOT EVEN SPEAK SMILINGLY TO, ANY OTHER WOMAN; DID
PIERRE'S SUBJECTION CONSISTED IN THE FACT THAT HE NOT ONLY DARED NOT

FLATTERED HIM, AND HE SUBMITTED TO THEM.
HER AND TO THE FAMILY. HIS WIFE'S DEMANDS ASTONISHED HIM, BUT THEY ALSO
TO HIM A PERFECTLY NOVEL ONE, THAT EVERY MOMENT OF HIS LIFE BELONGED TO
ANNOUNCED HER DEMANDS. PIERRE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED BY HIS WIFE'S VIEW,
TRUE. FROM THE VERY FIRST DAYS OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE NATASHA HAD
OPINION WAS THAT PIERRE WAS UNDER HIS WIFE'S THUMB, WHICH WAS REALLY
PLAIN--WERE HABITUAL SUBJECTS OF JEST TO THOSE ABOUT HER. THE GENERAL
JEALOUS OF SONYA, OF THE GOVERNESS, AND OF EVERY WOMAN, PRETTY OR
AND DID HER HAIR, HER ILL-CHOSEN WORDS, AND HER JEALOUSY--SHE WAS
TO SUCH AN EXTENT HAD NATASHA LET HERSELF GO THAT THE WAY SHE DRESSED

MUCH BETTER.
FROM WHOM SHE COULD HEAR REASSURING WORDS TO THE EFFECT THAT BABY WAS
JOYFUL FACE SHOW A YELLOW INSTEAD OF A GREEN STAIN ON BABY'S NAPKIN, AND
STRIDING DISHEVELED FROM THE NURSERY IN HER DRESSING GOWN, AND WITH
AND SONYA. SHE VALUED THE COMPANY OF THOSE TO WHOM SHE COULD COME
SOCIETY OF HER RELATIVES--COUNTESS MARY, AND HER BROTHER, HER MOTHER,
NATASHA DID NOT CARE FOR SOCIETY IN GENERAL, BUT PRIZED THE MORE THE

DIFFERENT.
IMAGINE AND SAW NO INTEREST IN IMAGINING HOW IT WOULD BE IF THINGS WERE
SOUL WERE INTENT ON SERVING THAT HUSBAND AND FAMILY, SHE COULD NOT
NO NEED OF ANY OTHER OR BETTER HUSBAND, BUT AS ALL THE POWERS OF HER
A HUSBAND WAS GIVEN HER AND HE GAVE HER A FAMILY. AND SHE NOT ONLY SAW
THE FAMILY--THAT IS, ONE WIFE OR ONE HUSBAND. NATASHA NEEDED A HUSBAND.
CAN DIGEST, AND NOT HAVING MORE WIVES OR HUSBANDS THAN ARE NEEDED FOR
FAMILY, THE WHOLE QUESTION RESOLVES ITSELF INTO NOT EATING MORE THAN ONE
IF THE PURPOSE OF FOOD IS NOURISHMENT AND THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THE

CASE WILL NOT HAVE A FAMILY.
MANY WIVES OR HUSBANDS MAY PERHAPS OBTAIN MUCH PLEASURE, BUT IN THAT
IF THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THE FAMILY, THE PERSON WHO WISHES TO HAVE

PURPOSE, FOR HIS STOMACH WILL NOT DIGEST THE TWO DINNERS.
DINNERS AT ONCE MAY PERHAPS GET MORE ENJOYMENT BUT WILL NOT ATTAIN HIS
IF THE PURPOSE OF DINNER IS TO NOURISH THE BODY, A MAN WHO EATS TWO

NOURISHMENT IT AFFORDS; AND THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THE FAMILY.
AND DO NOT NOW EXIST FOR THOSE FOR WHOM THE PURPOSE OF A DINNER IS THE
HOW TO GET THE GREATEST GRATIFICATION FROM ONE'S DINNER, DID NOT THEN
DISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS OF THAT KIND, WHICH ARE LIKE THE QUESTION OF

LIES IN THE FAMILY.
ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF MARRIAGE AND NOT ITS WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE, WHICH
MARRIAGE BUT THE PLEASURE MARRIED PEOPLE GET FROM ONE ANOTHER, THAT IS,
THESE QUESTIONS, THEN AS NOW, EXISTED ONLY FOR THOSE WHO SEE NOTHING IN

DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM.
THESE TOPICS WERE NOT MERELY UNINTERESTING TO NATASHA, SHE POSITIVELY
THOUGH THESE THEMES WERE NOT YET TERMED QUESTIONS AS THEY ARE NOW; BUT
RIGHTS, THE RELATIONS OF HUSBAND AND WIFE AND THEIR FREEDOM AND RIGHTS,
THERE WERE THEN AS NOW CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WOMEN'S

WAS UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THAT SHE CONSIDERED NECESSARY.
APPEAR, SO THAT SHE CONCENTRATED THEM WHOLLY ON THAT ONE THING AND YET
DID THAT SUBJECT GROW AND THE WEAKER AND MORE INADEQUATE DID HER POWERS
SOUL, HER WHOLE BEING, INTO THE SUBJECT THAT ABSORBED HER, THE LARGER
AND THE DEEPER SHE PENETRATED, NOT WITH HER MIND ONLY BUT WITH HER WHOLE

BRING INTO THE WORLD, NURSE, AND BRING UP.
ENTIRELY TO HER AND TO THE HOME, AND THE CHILDREN WHOM SHE HAD TO BEAR,
THAT IS, HER HUSBAND WHOM SHE HAD TO KEEP SO THAT HE SHOULD BELONG
THE SUBJECT WHICH WHOLLY ENGROSSED NATASHA'S ATTENTION WAS HER FAMILY:

ATTENTION IS DEVOTED TO IT.
TRIVIAL THAT IT WILL NOT GROW TO INFINITE PROPORTIONS IF ONE'S ENTIRE
A SUBJECT HOWEVER TRIVIAL IT MAY BE, AND THAT THERE IS NO SUBJECT SO
WE KNOW THAT MAN HAS THE FACULTY OF BECOMING COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN

THESE THINGS.
OR TO CHOOSING HER WORDS WAS THAT SHE REALLY HAD NO TIME TO SPARE FOR
IT. THE CHIEF REASON FOR DEVOTING NO TIME EITHER TO SINGING, TO DRESS,
HAVE BEEN AGREEABLE--SHE DID NOT KNOW--BUT SHE HAD NO TIME AT ALL FOR
HERSELF TO ATTRACT HERSELF. TO ADORN HERSELF FOR OTHERS MIGHT PERHAPS
SONGS TO FASCINATE HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE SEEMED AS STRANGE AS TO ADORN
TO FLUFF OUT HER CURLS, PUT ON FASHIONABLE DRESSES, AND SING ROMANTIC

ELSE--INDEFINITE BUT FIRM AS THE BOND BETWEEN HER OWN BODY AND SOUL.
BY THE POETIC FEELINGS THAT HAD ATTRACTED HIM TO HER, BUT BY SOMETHING
FROM HIM. SHE FELT THAT HER UNITY WITH HER HUSBAND WAS NOT MAINTAINED
ENTIRELY--THAT IS, WITH HER WHOLE SOUL, LEAVING NO CORNER OF IT HIDDEN
HER HUSBAND, TO WHOM SHE HAD FROM THE FIRST MOMENT GIVEN HERSELF UP
TAUGHT HER TO USE WOULD NOW BE MERELY RIDICULOUS IN THE EYES OF
TO ALL THOSE RULES. SHE FELT THAT THE ALLUREMENTS INSTINCT HAD FORMERLY
INCONVENIENCING HIM BY BEING TOO EXACTING. SHE ACTED IN CONTRADICTION
HERSELF TO HER HUSBAND IN HER MOST BECOMING ATTITUDES, OR TO AVOID
HER MANNERS OR WITH DELICACY OF SPEECH, OR WITH HER TOILET, OR TO SHOW
JUST BECAUSE IT WAS SO POWERFULLY SEDUCTIVE. SHE TOOK NO PAINS WITH
OF WHICH HER SINGING HAD BEEN AN UNUSUALLY POWERFUL PART. SHE GAVE IT UP
HUSBAND. NATASHA ON THE CONTRARY HAD AT ONCE ABANDONED ALL HER WITCHERY,
SHOULD FASCINATE HER HUSBAND AS MUCH AS SHE DID BEFORE HE BECAME HER
EVEN MORE CAREFUL OF HER APPEARANCE THAN WHEN SHE WAS UNMARRIED, AND
GO WHEN SHE MARRIES, SHOULD NOT NEGLECT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS, SHOULD BE
ESPECIALLY BY THE FRENCH, WHICH SAYS THAT A GIRL SHOULD NOT LET HERSELF
NATASHA DID NOT FOLLOW THE GOLDEN RULE ADVOCATED BY CLEVER FOLK,

BOUNDS," SAID THE COUNTESS, "SO THAT IT EVEN BECOMES ABSURD."
"ONLY SHE LETS HER LOVE OF HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN OVERFLOW ALL

NATASHA WOULD MAKE AN EXEMPLARY WIFE AND MOTHER.
UNDERSTOOD NATASHA, AND SHE KEPT SAYING THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT
WAS NOW SURPRISED AT THE SURPRISE EXPRESSED BY THOSE WHO HAD NEVER
EXCLAIMED AT OTRADNOE NOT SO MUCH IN FUN AS IN EARNEST--AND HER MOTHER
BEEN DUE TO HER NEED OF CHILDREN AND A HUSBAND--AS SHE HERSELF HAD ONCE
HER MATERNAL INSTINCT HAD REALIZED THAT ALL NATASHA'S OUTBURSTS HAD
CHANGE IN HER AS AT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY. ONLY THE OLD COUNTESS WITH
SOCIETY. ALL WHO HAD KNOWN NATASHA BEFORE HER MARRIAGE WONDERED AT THE
SHE HAD DEMANDS ON HER TIME WHICH COULD BE SATISFIED ONLY BY RENOUNCING
NURSING OF HER CHILDREN, AND SHARING EVERY MOMENT OF HER HUSBAND'S LIFE,
THAT SHE DID NOT--BUT WITH HER PREGNANCIES, HER CONFINEMENTS, THE
SOLITUDE--SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE LIKED IT OR NOT, SHE EVEN THOUGHT
AND FOUND HER NEITHER ATTRACTIVE NOR AMIABLE. NOT THAT NATASHA LIKED
IN SOCIETY, AND THOSE WHO MET HER THERE WERE NOT PLEASED WITH HER
SAY, IN NICHOLAS' HOUSE. THE YOUNG COUNTESS BEZUKHOVA WAS NOT OFTEN SEEN
PETERSBURG, ON THEIR ESTATE NEAR MOSCOW, OR WITH HER MOTHER, THAT IS TO
SINCE THEIR MARRIAGE NATASHA AND HER HUSBAND HAD LIVED IN MOSCOW, IN

ATTRACTIVE THAN IN FORMER DAYS.
DID KINDLE IN HER HANDSOME, FULLY DEVELOPED BODY SHE WAS EVEN MORE
ABANDONED SINCE HER MARRIAGE. AT THE RARE MOMENTS WHEN THE OLD FIRE
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO INDUCE HER TO SING, A PRACTICE SHE HAD QUITE
WAS JEALOUS OF PRINCE ANDREW'S MEMORY), OR ON THE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN
PRINCE ANDREW (SHE NEVER MENTIONED HIM TO HER HUSBAND, WHO SHE IMAGINED
OR A SICK CHILD WAS CONVALESCENT, OR WHEN SHE AND COUNTESS MARY SPOKE OF
HAPPENED ONLY WHEN, AS WAS THE CASE THAT DAY, HER HUSBAND RETURNED HOME,
FERTILE WOMAN. THE OLD FIRE VERY RARELY KINDLED IN HER FACE NOW. THAT
NOT VISIBLE AT ALL. ALL THAT STRUCK THE EYE WAS A STRONG, HANDSOME, AND
NOW HER FACE AND BODY WERE OFTEN ALL THAT ONE SAW, AND HER SOUL WAS
ANIMATION THAT HAD FORMERLY BURNED THERE AND CONSTITUTED ITS CHARM.
AND SERENE EXPRESSION. IN HER FACE THERE WAS NONE OF THE EVER-GLOWING
FORMER DAYS. HER FEATURES WERE MORE DEFINED AND HAD A CALM, SOFT,
TO RECOGNIZE IN THIS ROBUST, MOTHERLY WOMAN THE SLIM, LIVELY NATASHA OF
NOW NURSING. SHE HAD GROWN STOUTER AND BROADER, SO THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT
THREE DAUGHTERS BESIDES A SON FOR WHOM SHE HAD LONGED AND WHOM SHE WAS
NATASHA HAD MARRIED IN THE EARLY SPRING OF 1813, AND IN 1820 ALREADY HAD

UNATTAINABLE IN THIS LIFE AND OF WHICH SHE INVOLUNTARILY THOUGHT AT THAT
FELT, THROUGH HER HAPPINESS, THAT THERE IS ANOTHER SORT OF HAPPINESS

COUNTESS MARY REMAINED IN THE SITTING ROOM.

DANCED DANIEL COOPER WITH HIS DAUGHTER.
INTO SOCIETY AND DANCING THE MAZURKA WITH HER AS HIS OLD FATHER HAD
THOUGHT OF WHAT SHE WOULD BE LIKE WHEN HE WAS AN OLD MAN, TAKING HER
HIM OF DANCING, AND LOOKING AT THE CHILD'S ROUND HAPPY LITTLE FACE HE
FROM HIS SHOULDER AND PRESSED HER TO HIS HEART. HIS CAPERS REMINDED
GALLOP ROUND THE ROOM. OUT OF BREATH, HE TOOK THE LAUGHING CHILD QUICKLY

"I AM SURE IT IS PIERRE. I WILL GO AND SEE," SAID COUNTESS MARY AND LEFT

"SOMEBODY HAS COME."

AT THAT MOMENT THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE DOOR PULLEY AND FOOTSTEPS IN

"BUT YOU KNOW YOU MAY BE UNFAIR. YOU ARE TOO FOND OF THIS ONE," HIS WIFE

"YES, YES." AND NICHOLAS, TAKING HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER IN HIS STRONG HAND,

"I DID NOT NOTICE HIM FOLLOWING ME," SHE SAID TIMIDLY. "I JUST LOOKED

NICHOLAS LOWERED HIS LEGS, ROSE, AND TOOK HIS DAUGHTER IN HIS ARMS.

"NO, MAMMA, HE DOESN'T WANT TO SLEEP," SAID LITTLE NATASHA WITH

COUNTESS MARY. SHE KNEW HOW NICHOLAS DISLIKED BEING WAKED. THEN THROUGH

HE IS PUSHED INTO A MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE. IN ALARM HE WISHES TO

HE REACHES PARIS, THE DISSOLUTION OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH A

SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT, AND AGAIN THE ENEMY'S FLEET TWICE LETS HIM SLIP
IGNOBLE DEPARTURE FROM AFRICA, LEAVING HIS COMRADES IN DISTRESS, IS
IMPUTED TO HIM AS A FAULT. HIS CHILDISHLY RASH, UNCALLED-FOR, AND
PLAGUE DOES NOT TOUCH HIM. THE CRUELTY OF MURDERING PRISONERS IS NOT
HAD SCOPE FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA. WHATEVER HE DOES SUCCEEDS. THE

SURRENDERS WITHOUT A SHOT; HIS MOST RECKLESS SCHEMES ARE CROWNED WITH

PRESENTS ITSELF IN THE FORM OF AN AIMLESS AND SENSELESS EXPEDITION
OUT AND DESTROYED. AND BY CHANCE AN ESCAPE FROM THIS DANGEROUS POSITION
OF DISSOLUTION IN WHICH ALL THOSE WHO ARE IN IT ARE INEVITABLY WIPED
ON HIS RETURN FROM ITALY HE FINDS THE GOVERNMENT IN PARIS IN A PROCESS

HIS PRESTIGE--DO NOT APPEAR UPON THE SCENE TILL HE IS NO LONGER THERE.
CONSIDERATIONS THE RUSSIAN ARMIES--JUST THOSE WHICH MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED
EACH TIME IS SAVED IN AN UNEXPECTED MANNER. OWING TO VARIOUS DIPLOMATIC
THE WAR IN ITALY HE IS SEVERAL TIMES ON THE VERGE OF DESTRUCTION AND
SERVICE, AND THE APPOINTMENT HE SEEKS IN TURKEY COMES TO NOTHING. DURING
PREDESTINED PATH ARE UNSUCCESSFUL: HE IS NOT RECEIVED INTO THE RUSSIAN
RULERS OF FRANCE TURNS TO HIS ADVANTAGE. HIS ATTEMPTS TO AVOID HIS
ACCOMPANY HIM EVERYWHERE. THE DISFAVOR INTO WHICH HE FALLS WITH THE
SELF-CONFIDENCE SECURE HIM MILITARY FAME. INNUMERABLE SO CALLED CHANCES
HIS OPPONENTS' RELUCTANCE TO FIGHT, AND HIS OWN CHILDISH AUDACITY AND
ARMY. THE BRILLIANT QUALITIES OF THE SOLDIERS OF THE ARMY SENT TO ITALY,
SELF-CONFIDENT LIMITATIONS OF THIS MAN RAISE HIM TO THE HEAD OF THE
HIS OPPONENTS, THE FRANKNESS OF HIS FALSEHOODS, AND THE DAZZLING AND
THE IGNORANCE OF HIS COLLEAGUES, THE WEAKNESS AND INSIGNIFICANCE OF

ANY ONE OF THEM IS BORNE FORWARD TO A PROMINENT POSITION.

"TO SPEAK TO HER NOW WOULDN'T DO," SAID THE PRINCESS ALL THE SAME.

SPOKE OF HIS LOVE, BUT THAT IT WAS THE VERY THING SHE WISHED FOR.
IN NATASHA TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT SHE WOULD NOT ONLY NOT BE HURT IF PIERRE

PIERRE GAZED AT THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD DISAPPEARED AND DID NOT

NOR OF WHAT SHE WAS TELLING. HE LISTENED TO HER AND FELT ONLY PITY FOR

PIERRE LISTENED TO HER WITH LIPS PARTED AND EYES FIXED UPON HER FULL OF

THE FAULTS HE HAD--IF HE HAD ANY--WERE NOT OF HIS MAKING. SO HE DID

PIERRE'S CONFUSION HAD NOW ALMOST VANISHED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT

HE NEVER KNEW OR REMEMBERED. "THIS MUST BE ONE OF HER COMPANIONS," HE
ALWAYS HAD LADY COMPANIONS, BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE LIKE

THE PEOPLE IN SO STRANGE A MANNER, CONTRARY TO THE TSAR'S WISH, TO
ONLY THE RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT HE POSSESSED THIS FEELING CAUSED

FULL PURITY AND STRENGTH.
EVENTS THEN OCCURING LAY IN THE NATIONAL FEELING WHICH HE POSSESSED IN
THE SOURCE OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY POWER OF PENETRATING THE MEANING OF THE

IN ALL HIS ACTIVITY HE WAS NEVER ONCE UNTRUE TO IT?
SO TRULY DISCERN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PEOPLE'S VIEW OF THE EVENTS THAT
BUT HOW DID THAT OLD MAN, ALONE, IN OPPOSITION TO THE GENERAL OPINION,

RESULTS NOW LIE BEFORE US.
EXISTED ONLY IN THE HEADS OF A DOZEN INDIVIDUALS--FOR THE EVENTS AND
ONLY WE ABSTAIN FROM ATTRIBUTING TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE MASS AIMS THAT
IT IS EASY NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE EVENTS--IF

CROSSED.
AND THAT A NEW WAR SHOULD NOT BE BEGUN NOR THE FRONTIERS OF RUSSIA
INSISTED THAT BATTLES, WHICH WERE USELESS THEN, SHOULD NOT BE FOUGHT,
WINNING A BATTLE WAS UNPRECEDENTED. HE ALONE DURING THE WHOLE RETREAT
LOST AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT FOR AN ARMY TO HAVE TO RETIRE AFTER
WAS A VICTORY, DESPITE THE ASSURANCE OF GENERALS THAT THE BATTLE WAS
CONTRADICTION TO EVERYONE ELSE, DECLARED TILL HIS DEATH THAT BORODINO
THE BATTLE OF AUSTERLITZ BEGAN SAID THAT IT WOULD BE LOST, HE ALONE, IN
PREPARATIONS FOR IT WITH UNPARALLELED SOLEMNITY. THIS KUTUZOV WHO BEFORE

TO ONE AND THE SAME THREEFOLD END: (1) TO BRACE ALL HIS STRENGTH FOR
EVENTS. HIS ACTIONS--WITHOUT THE SMALLEST DEVIATION--WERE ALL DIRECTED
NOR DO WORDS ALONE PROVE THAT ONLY HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE

USELESS AND HARMFUL.
DISPLEASURE--SAID IN VILNA THAT TO CARRY THE WAR BEYOND THE FRONTIER IS
TO PLEASE THE EMPEROR, HE ALONE--INCURRING THEREBY THE EMPEROR'S
AND THIS COURTIER, AS HE IS DESCRIBED TO US, WHO LIES TO ARAKCHEEV

NOT SACRIFICE A SINGLE RUSSIAN FOR TEN FRENCHMEN.
WE MUST KEEP SOME FORCE TO REACH THE FRONTIER WITH, AND THAT HE WOULD
THE TARUTINO, THE VYAZMA, NOR THE KRASNOE BATTLES WERE NECESSARY; THAT
DESIRE; THAT THE ENEMY MUST BE OFFERED "A GOLDEN BRIDGE"; THAT NEITHER
USELESS, EVERYTHING IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED OF ITSELF BETTER THAN WE COULD
ALONE DURING THE RETREAT OF THE FRENCH SAID THAT ALL OUR MANEUVERS ARE
PEACE, HE SAID: THERE CAN BE NO PEACE, FOR SUCH IS THE PEOPLE'S WILL. HE
MOSCOW IS NOT THE LOSS OF RUSSIA. IN REPLY TO LAURISTON'S PROPOSAL OF
AND REPORTS UP TO THE TIME OF HIS DEATH. HE ALONE SAID THAT THE LOSS OF
WAS A VICTORY, AND REPEATED THIS BOTH VERBALLY AND IN HIS DISPATCHES
WITH THOSE ABOUT HIM BEGAN, HE ALONE SAID THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO

THOUGHTS WITH THE BITTER CONVICTION THAT HE WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD.
HIMSELF, IN VERY DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES, HE REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED HIS REAL
TOWARD WHICH HE MOVED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WAR. OBVIOUSLY IN SPITE OF
TIME OF HIS ACTIVITY UTTER ONE WORD INCONSISTENT WITH THE SINGLE AIM
BUT THAT MAN, SO HEEDLESS OF HIS WORDS, DID NOT ONCE DURING THE WHOLE

MEANINGLESS WORDS THAT HAPPENED TO ENTER HIS HEAD.
WORDS SERVING AS THEIR EXPRESSION ARE NOT WHAT MOVE PEOPLE--USE QUITE
EXPERIENCE OF LIFE HAD REACHED THE CONVICTION THAT THOUGHTS AND THE

CONTRARY. WHAT DID IT MATTER TO HIM--WHO THEN ALONE AMID A SENSELESS
JUST SAYING SO MYSELF," THOUGH A MOMENT BEFORE HE HAD SAID QUITE THE
BE APPOINTED CHIEF OF THE ARTILLERY, KUTUZOV REPLIED: "YES, I WAS
ARAKCHEEV, COMING TO HIM FROM THE EMPEROR, SAID THAT ERMOLOV OUGHT TO
MOSCOW WITHOUT A BATTLE," THOUGH MOSCOW WAS THEN ALREADY ABANDONED. WHEN
MOSCOW WITHOUT A BATTLE?" KUTUZOV REPLIED: "AND I SHALL NOT ABANDON

DISTANCE THAN THEY HAD ALREADY TRAVERSED, BEFORE THEY REACHED THE
AND WHO AT THE BEST IF THE FLIGHT CONTINUED WOULD HAVE TO GO A GREATER
MONTH AND WITHOUT FIGHTING A BATTLE HAD DWINDLED TO HALF THEIR NUMBER,
SOLDIERS--ILL-SHOD, INSUFFICIENTLY CLAD, AND HALF STARVED--WHO WITHIN A
ANOTHER THEY PRESENTED PROJECTS OF MANEUVERS TO BE MADE WITH THOSE

SAME TIME HE LIKE THE SOLDIERS REALIZED ALL THE HARDSHIP OF THIS MARCH,
BEATEN, THAT THE ENEMY WAS FLYING AND MUST BE DRIVEN OUT; BUT AT THE
HIS RUSSIAN BEING--WHAT EVERY RUSSIAN SOLDIER FELT: THAT THE FRENCH WERE

DIRECTED DURING THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN FROM MOSCOW TO VILNA--NOT CASUALLY OR
AIM WAS TO SHORTEN THOSE MARCHES. TO THAT END KUTUZOV'S ACTIVITY WAS

THE ARTFUL MANEUVERS SUGGESTED BY OUR GENERALS MEANT FRESH MOVEMENTS OF
AT SOME DISTANCE COULD ONE CUT ACROSS THE ZIGZAG PATH OF THE FRENCH. ALL
THEIR HEELS THE GREATER DISTANCE THEY HAD TO COVER. ONLY BY FOLLOWING
FRENCH WOULD TAKE WAS UNKNOWN, AND SO THE CLOSER OUR TROOPS TROD ON
THE AIM OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS TO PURSUE THE FRENCH. THE ROAD THE
REASON FOR SLACKENING THE PACE AND DELAYING PRESENTED ITSELF TO KUTUZOV.
ARMY CAUSED BY THE RAPIDITY OF THE ADVANCE HAD BECOME EVIDENT, ANOTHER
BUT BESIDES THIS, SINCE THE EXHAUSTION AND ENORMOUS DIMINUTION OF THE

ARMY.

ARMY GENERALS, DIRECTED HIS WHOLE ACTIVITY HERE, AS HE HAD DONE AT
MOVEMENT OF THE FRENCH AS WAS DESIRED IN PETERSBURG AND BY THE RUSSIAN
KUTUZOV AS FAR AS WAS IN HIS POWER, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CHECK THE

CORRESPONDING DECREASE OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY.
THE RAPIDITY OF ITS MOVEMENT, AND A CONVINCING PROOF OF THIS IS THE
OWN PEOPLE. THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE WASTAGE OF NAPOLEON'S ARMY WAS
IN ENEMY HANDS WHILE THE SICK RUSSIANS LEFT BEHIND WERE AMONG THEIR
AS HUNG OVER THE FRENCH, AND THAT THE SICK FRENCHMEN WERE LEFT BEHIND
THE RUSSIAN ARMY MOVED VOLUNTARILY, WITH NO SUCH THREAT OF DESTRUCTION
AS THE FLIGHT OF THE FRENCH WAS TO THEIRS. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THAT
THE RAPIDITY OF THE RUSSIAN PURSUIT WAS JUST AS DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR ARMY

HUNDRED THOUSAND STRONG REACHED KRASNOE WITH ONLY FIFTY THOUSAND.
LESS THAN A HUNDRED PRISONERS, THE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH LEFT THAT PLACE A
LOSING MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND KILLED AND WOUNDED AFTER TARUTINO AND
NECESSARY TO GRASP CLEARLY THE MEANING OF THE FACT THAT, WHILE NOT
TO REALIZE THE DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY IT IS ONLY

FASTER.
AT THE RATE OF TWENTY-SEVEN MILES A DAY THAT THEY COULD NOT GO ANY
THE MEN IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY WERE SO WORN OUT BY THIS CONTINUOUS MARCHING

INFORMATION RECEIVED OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FRENCH WAS NEVER RELIABLE.
NOT KEEP UP WITH THEM; CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY HORSES BROKE DOWN, AND THE
FLIGHT WAS SO RAPID THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY PURSUING THE FRENCH COULD

SO ON, THE FARTHER MOVEMENT OF THE FLEEING FRENCH, AND OF THE RUSSIANS

AT THE END OF JANUARY PRINCESS MARY LEFT FOR MOSCOW, AND THE COUNT

FROM WITHIN.
IT WOULD SOON NO LONGER BE SEEN OR NOTICED. THE WOUND HAD BEGUN TO HEAL
COVER WITH THEIR LIVING VERDURE THE GRIEF THAT WEIGHED HER DOWN THAT
YOUNG SHOOTS OF GRASS WERE ALREADY SPROUTING, WHICH TAKING ROOT WOULD SO
OF SLIME THAT COVERED HER SOUL AND SEEMED TO HER IMPENETRABLE, DELICATE

AGAIN--THOUGH SHE COULD HEAR DUNYASHA COMING--CALLED HER IN THE DEEP
ANOTHER TIME WHEN SHE CALLED DUNYASHA HER VOICE TREMBLED, SO SHE CALLED

THEN, TESTING HER STRENGTH, RAN UPSTAIRS AGAIN, OBSERVING THE RESULT.
UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE IMMEDIATELY INVENTED A REASON FOR GOING DOWN, AND
ONE DAY SHE WENT QUICKLY UPSTAIRS AND FOUND HERSELF OUT OF BREATH.

CAREFULLY, SURPRISED AT ITS THINNESS, AND IN THE MORNING NOTICED HER
AND LOSS OF GOOD LOOKS, AND INVOLUNTARILY SHE EXAMINED HER BARE ARM
SUDDENLY OVERCOME BY FEAR NOT ONLY OF DEATH BUT OF SICKNESS, WEAKNESS,
TALKED ABOUT HER HEALTH, AND THIS PLEASED HER. BUT SOMETIMES SHE WAS

YOUTH, THERE ALSO OPENED OUT A NEW AND HITHERTO UNCOMPREHENDED SIDE OF
PRINCESS MARY, LISTENING TO NATASHA'S TALES OF CHILDHOOD AND EARLY
AND LOVED IN ANOTHER THOSE PREVIOUSLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE VIRTUES. FOR
OWN LIFE, FOR SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SEEK OTHER JOYS, BUT SHE UNDERSTOOD
HER. SHE DID NOT THINK OF APPLYING SUBMISSION AND SELF-ABNEGATION TO HER
PAST TOO AND TO UNDERSTAND A SIDE OF LIFE PREVIOUSLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO
FEELING HERSELF BOUND TO PRINCESS MARY BY AFFECTION, LEARNED TO LOVE HER
DEVOTION, SUBMISSION, AND THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN SELF-SACRIFICE, NOW
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAD FORMERLY TURNED AWAY FROM THAT LIFE OF
MOTHER, HER FATHER, AND HER DAYDREAMS; AND NATASHA, WHO WITH A PASSIVE
OF WHAT WAS LONG PAST. PRINCESS MARY SPOKE OF HER CHILDHOOD, OF HER
IN BED THEY WOULD BEGIN TALKING AND GO ON TILL MORNING. THEY SPOKE MOST
SOMETIMES THEY WERE SILENT FOR HOURS; SOMETIMES AFTER THEY WERE ALREADY

FEELING OF LIFE BEING POSSIBLE ONLY IN EACH OTHER'S PRESENCE.
FEELING STRONGER THAN FRIENDSHIP SPRANG UP BETWEEN THEM; AN EXCLUSIVE
WITH ONE ANOTHER THAN EITHER OF THEM FELT WITH HERSELF WHEN ALONE. A
RESTLESS AND HASTENED TO REJOIN HER. TOGETHER THEY FELT MORE IN HARMONY
SPENT MOST OF THEIR TIME TOGETHER. WHEN ONE WENT OUT THE OTHER BECAME
WERE CONTINUALLY KISSING AND SAYING TENDER THINGS TO ONE ANOTHER AND
BETWEEN WOMEN WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN PRINCESS MARY AND NATASHA. THEY
FROM THAT DAY A TENDER AND PASSIONATE FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS EXISTS ONLY

PRINCESS MARY FEEL SHY BUT HAPPY BY THIS DEMONSTRATION OF HER FEELINGS.
AND NATASHA, EMBRACING HER, BEGAN KISSING HER FACE AND HANDS, MAKING

LET US BE QUITE, QUITE FRIENDS."
"MARY, YOU MUSTN'T THINK ME WICKED. NO? MARY DARLING, HOW I LOVE YOU!
"MARY," SHE SAID TIMIDLY, DRAWING PRINCESS MARY'S HAND TO HERSELF,

DOES SHE THINK ABOUT ME? YES, SHE IS SPLENDID!"
IS IN HER HEART? ALL THAT IS GOOD. BUT HOW? WHAT IS HER MIND LIKE? WHAT
IS QUITE ORIGINAL, STRANGE, NEW, AND UNKNOWN. AND SHE LOVES ME. WHAT
"IS SHE LIKE HIM?" THOUGHT NATASHA. "YES, LIKE AND YET NOT LIKE. BUT SHE

PRINCESS MARY'S FACE.
NATASHA LAY ON THE BED AND IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE ROOM SCANNED

"SHE IS MUCH BETTER. SHE SPOKE SO WELL TODAY," SAID PRINCESS MARY.

"NO, NO. WHY DID YOU BRING ME AWAY? SHE WILL BE ASKING FOR ME."

"YOU ARE TIRED--TRY TO SLEEP."

"I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP, MARY, SIT BY ME A LITTLE."

CALLED HER BACK.
BUT WHEN PRINCESS MARY HAD DRAWN THE BLINDS AND WAS GOING AWAY SHE
HER TO HER OWN ROOM AND MADE HER LIE DOWN ON THE BED. NATASHA LAY DOWN,
ONE AFTERNOON NOTICING NATASHA SHIVERING WITH FEVER, PRINCESS MARY TOOK

HAD STRAINED NATASHA'S PHYSICAL STRENGTH.
SHE HAD BEEN A SICK CHILD. THE LAST WEEKS PASSED IN HER MOTHER'S BEDROOM
PUT OFF HER DEPARTURE, AND FOR THREE WEEKS LOOKED AFTER NATASHA AS IF
THIS NEW SORROW BROUGHT THEM STILL CLOSER TO ONE ANOTHER. PRINCESS MARY
PRINCE ANDREW'S LAST DAYS HAD BOUND PRINCESS MARY AND NATASHA TOGETHER;

LIFE--LOVE--WAS STILL ACTIVE WITHIN HER. LOVE AWOKE AND SO DID LIFE.
BUT HER LOVE FOR HER MOTHER UNEXPECTEDLY SHOWED HER THAT THE ESSENCE OF
NATASHA'S WOUND HEALED IN THAT WAY. SHE THOUGHT HER LIFE WAS ENDED,

HEAL COMPLETELY ONLY AS THE RESULT OF A VITAL FORCE FROM WITHIN.
HEAL AND ITS EDGES JOIN, PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL WOUNDS ALIKE CAN YET
A PHYSICAL WOUND AND, STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM, JUST AS A DEEP WOUND MAY
A SPIRITUAL WOUND PRODUCED BY A RENDING OF THE SPIRITUAL BODY IS LIKE

A LISTLESS OLD WOMAN TAKING NO INTEREST IN LIFE. BUT THE SAME BLOW THAT

THE MOTHER'S WOUNDED SPIRIT COULD NOT HEAL. PETYA'S DEATH HAD TORN FROM

MOTHER.
BECAUSE THE MERE SOUND OF HER TENDER, CARESSING TONES SOOTHED HER
IN HER ROOM, MAKING HER EAT AND DRINK, AND TALKING TO HER INCESSANTLY
REMAINED CONSTANTLY AT HER MOTHER'S SIDE, SLEEPING ON A LOUNGE CHAIR

REPLACE NATASHA BUT COULD NOT. THEY SAW THAT SHE ALONE WAS ABLE TO

"MAMMA! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING..."

MANLY," CONTINUED THE COUNTESS, TAKING HER DAUGHTER'S HAND.
NATASHA WENT UP TO HER. "YOU HAVE IMPROVED IN LOOKS AND GROWN MORE
"HOW GLAD I AM YOU HAVE COME. YOU ARE TIRED. WON'T YOU HAVE SOME TEA?"

SITTING UP IN BED AND SPEAKING SOFTLY.
BUT OPENED THEM AGAIN ON HEARING THE BEDSTEAD CREAK. THE COUNTESS WAS
AND NATASHA RESTED HER HEAD ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND CLOSED HER EYES,
DURING THE THIRD NIGHT THE COUNTESS KEPT VERY QUIET FOR A FEW MINUTES,

EVERY MOMENT, NOT EXPLAINING OR CONSOLING, BUT RECALLING HER TO LIFE.
PERSEVERING AND PATIENT LOVE SEEMED COMPLETELY TO SURROUND THE COUNTESS
NEXT DAY AND NIGHT. SHE DID NOT SLEEP AND DID NOT LEAVE HER MOTHER. HER
NATASHA DID NOT REMEMBER HOW THAT DAY PASSED NOR THAT NIGHT, NOR THE

OF LIFE, ESCAPED FROM REALITY INTO A WORLD OF DELIRIUM.
BELIEVE THAT SHE COULD LIVE WHEN HER BELOVED BOY WAS KILLED IN THE BLOOM
AND AGAIN IN A FUTILE STRUGGLE WITH REALITY HER MOTHER, REFUSING TO

MOTHER.
FIND SOME WAY OF TAKING ON HERSELF THE EXCESS OF GRIEF THAT CRUSHED HER
"MY DARLING MUMMY!" SHE REPEATED, STRAINING ALL THE POWER OF HER LOVE TO

NOTHING BUT LOVE AND AN ENTREATY FOR FORGIVENESS.
NATASHA LOOKED AT HER WITH EYES FULL OF TEARS AND IN HER LOOK THERE WAS

"NATASHA, YOU LOVE ME?" SHE SAID IN A SOFT TRUSTFUL WHISPER. "NATASHA,

QUIET FOR A MOMENT. SUDDENLY SHE SAT UP WITH UNACCUSTOMED SWIFTNESS,
THE COUNTESS PRESSED HER DAUGHTER'S HAND, CLOSED HER EYES, AND BECAME

IRREPRESSIBLE AND STREAMING TEARS TICKLING HER NOSE AND CHEEKS.
INCESSANTLY, KISSING HER HEAD, HER HANDS, HER FACE, AND FEELING HER OWN

CHOKING HIM. WHEN HE SAW NATASHA HE WAVED HIS ARMS DESPAIRINGLY AND
HAD EVIDENTLY RUN OUT OF THAT ROOM TO GIVE VENT TO THE SOBS THAT WERE
HER MOTHER'S ROOM. HIS FACE WAS PUCKERED UP AND WET WITH TEARS. HE

LOOK. "A MISFORTUNE... ABOUT PETER ILYNICH... A LETTER," SHE FINISHED
"COME TO YOUR PAPA AT ONCE, PLEASE!" SAID SHE WITH A STRANGE, EXCITED

ON HER FACE AND SHOWING NO CONCERN FOR HER MISTRESS.
HER MAID, ENTERED THE ROOM QUICKLY AND ABRUPTLY WITH A FRIGHTENED LOOK
LOUD RATTLE OF THE DOOR HANDLE STRUCK PAINFULLY ON HER EARS. DUNYASHA,
WHEN IT SEEMED THAT THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WAS REVEALING ITSELF TO HER A
IT SEEMED TO HER SHE WAS PENETRATING THE MYSTERY.... BUT AT THE INSTANT
STRAINED FROWN SHE PEERED TOWARD THE WORLD WHERE HE WAS. AND NOW, NOW
AGAIN EVERYTHING WAS SHROUDED IN HARD, DRY PERPLEXITY, AND AGAIN WITH A
EYES; THEN SHE SUDDENLY ASKED HERSELF TO WHOM SHE WAS SAYING THIS.
SHE WAS OVERCOME BY SWEET SORROW AND TEARS WERE ALREADY RISING IN HER

DESPERATE EFFORT...
SHE SAID, CONVULSIVELY PRESSING HER HANDS AND SETTING HER TEETH WITH A
SAID THEN BUT ONLY SPOKE NOW: "I LOVE THEE!... THEE! I LOVE, LOVE..."
IMAGINATION SHE SAID OTHER TENDER AND LOVING WORDS WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE
PRESSED IT THAT TERRIBLE EVENING FOUR DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH. AND IN HER
HAPPINESS FOR ME," AND HE TOOK HER HAND AND PRESSED IT AS HE HAD
THERE IS NOTHING IN LIFE BUT YOU, AND TO SUFFER WITH YOU IS THE GREATEST
HIM AND SAID: "TERRIBLE FOR YOU, BUT NOT FOR ME! YOU KNOW THAT FOR ME
IMAGINATION NATASHA THIS TIME GAVE HIM A DIFFERENT ANSWER. SHE STOPPED
NOW HE AGAIN SEEMED TO BE SAYING THE SAME WORDS TO HER, ONLY IN HER
IT. AND NOW IT WILL NEVER, NEVER BE POSSIBLE TO PUT IT RIGHT." AND
NOTHING... NOBODY. DID HE KNOW THAT? NO, HE DID NOT AND NEVER WILL KNOW
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY COMPARED WITH WHAT I AM NOW. NOW THERE IS
SAID: EVEN IF HE HAD TO GO ON DYING, TO DIE CONTINUALLY BEFORE MY EYES,
I THOUGHT QUITE DIFFERENTLY. HAD I SAID WHAT I THOUGHT, I SHOULD HAVE

HE ALWAYS CONTINUED TO SUFFER. I SAID IT THEN ONLY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE

VYAZMA AND TARUTINO.
FOR WE KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE TROOPS FROM ATTACKING AT

THE RUSSIANS AIMED AT.
WITH ITS MARSHALS, KINGS, AND EMPEROR WAS NOT CAPTURED, IF THAT WAS WHAT
AT THE BEREZINA (IN BOTH CASES WE HAD SUPERIOR FORCES), THE FRENCH ARMY
WHY, THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY BEING WHAT IT WAS AT KRASNOE AND
WERE THE CAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN FAILURES, IT IS STILL INCOMPREHENSIBLE

BUT WHY DID THEY NOT EXECUTE THOSE MANEUVERS? AND WHY IF THEY WERE

THIS MAN AND THAT MAN, DID NOT EXECUTE SUCH AND SUCH MANEUVERS...
SAYS THAT THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE KUTUZOV AND TORMASOV AND CHICHAGOV, AND
HISTORY (OR WHAT IS CALLED BY THAT NAME) REPLYING TO THESE QUESTIONS

SURROUNDED THEM WITH SUPERIOR FORCES WE COULD NOT BEAT THEM? HOW COULD
THEM? CAN THE FRENCH BE SO ENORMOUSLY SUPERIOR TO US THAT WHEN WE HAD
HAD SURROUNDED THE FRENCH ON THREE SIDES AND WHEN ITS AIM WAS TO CAPTURE
FRENCH HAD GIVEN BATTLE AT BORODINO, DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSE WHEN IT
HOW WAS IT THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY, WHICH WHEN NUMERICALLY WEAKER THAN THE

CAPTURE THEM ALL?
THE AIM OF THE RUSSIANS WAS TO STOP THE FRENCH, TO CUT THEM OFF, AND
AND FREEZING, SURRENDERED IN CROWDS, AND WHEN (AS THE HISTORIANS RELATE)
SURROUNDED THEM IN SUPERIOR NUMBERS, WHEN THE DISORDERED FRENCH, HUNGRY
THAT THE FRENCH WERE NOT ALL CAPTURED OR DESTROYED WHEN OUR THREE ARMIES

"BROTHERS! DEAR FELLOWS! DARLINGS!" OLD SOLDIERS EXCLAIMED, WEEPING, AS

AROUND HE HEARD HIS COMRADES SOBBING WITH JOY.
FOR A LONG TIME HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM. ALL

RUSSIANS SURROUNDED PIERRE.

FRENCH SOLDIERS WERE RUNNING PAST HIM.

WITH A BEAUTIFUL POLISH LADY ON THE VERANDA OF HIS HOUSE IN KIEV. AND
WHY, THE RECOLLECTION CAME TO HIS MIND OF A SUMMER EVENING HE HAD SPENT
THAT KARATAEV HAD BEEN KILLED, BUT JUST AT THAT INSTANT, HE KNEW NOT
KARATAEV'S ABSENCE AT THIS HALT--AND HE WAS ON THE POINT OF REALIZING
FRENCHMEN AS THEY RAN PAST HIM, OF THE LOWERED AND SMOKING GUN, AND OF

JUST AS PIERRE DID, BUT THERE WAS A SET LOOK ON ALL THEIR FACES.
BACK AT THE PLACE WHERE THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED AND THE DOG WAS HOWLING,
HIS COMRADES, THE PRISONER SOLDIERS WALKING BESIDE HIM, AVOIDED LOOKING

"WHAT A STUPID BEAST! WHY IS IT HOWLING?" THOUGHT PIERRE.
BEHIND HIM, WHERE KARATAEV HAD BEEN SITTING, THE DOG BEGAN TO HOWL.

DRYING IT AT THE FIRE AND HOW THEY HAD LAUGHED AT HIM.
REMEMBERED THAT, TWO DAYS BEFORE, THAT MAN HAD BURNED HIS SHIRT WHILE
THE YOUNG SOLDIER AT THE EXECUTION. PIERRE LOOKED AT THE SOLDIER AND

HE AGAIN STARTED RECKONING. TWO FRENCH SOLDIERS RAN PAST PIERRE, ONE OF

HAD NOT YET FINISHED RECKONING UP HOW MANY STAGES STILL REMAINED TO
PIERRE HEARD IT PLAINLY, BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE REMEMBERED THAT HE
FROM BEHIND, WHERE KARATAEV HAD BEEN SITTING, CAME THE SOUND OF A SHOT.

BUT WENT LIMPING UP THE HILL.
FRENCHMEN WERE TALKING OVER HIS HEAD. PIERRE DID NOT LOOK ROUND AGAIN

DID NOT NOTICE THAT LOOK AND MOVED HASTILY AWAY.

KARATAEV'S FACE AS HE TOLD IT, AND THE MYSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT JOY.

"HOW AM I? IF WE GRUMBLE AT SICKNESS, GOD WON'T GRANT US DEATH," REPLIED

"WELL, HOW ARE YOU?" HE ASKED.

BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER FIRE, AND PIERRE SAT DOWN, TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT
FEELING OF PITY FOR THIS MAN FRIGHTENED HIM AND HE WISHED TO GO AWAY,
BRIGHTLY LIT UP BY THE BLAZE, HE FELT A PAINFUL PRICK AT HIS HEART. HIS
HEARD PLATON'S VOICE ENFEEBLED BY ILLNESS, AND SAW HIS PATHETIC FACE

WAS ALREADY PAST MIDNIGHT, THE HOUR WHEN KARATAEV WAS USUALLY FREE OF

PIERRE WALKED ALONG, LOOKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE, COUNTING HIS STEPS IN

WHICH RAN ALONG THE RUTS IN STREAMS.
HARDER THAN BEFORE. THE SATURATED ROAD NO LONGER ABSORBED THE WATER,
MIGHT CEASE AND THE SKY CLEAR, BUT AFTER A SHORT BREAK IT BEGAN RAINING
IT HAD BEEN RAINING SINCE MORNING AND HAD SEEMED AS IF AT ANY MOMENT IT

THEN AGAIN AT HIS FEET. THE FORMER AND THE LATTER WERE ALIKE FAMILIAR
THE WAY. OCCASIONALLY HE GLANCED AT THE FAMILIAR CROWD AROUND HIM AND
THE MUDDY, SLIPPERY ROAD, LOOKING AT HIS FEET AND AT THE ROUGHNESS OF

AND COMFORTING THOUGHTS, MEMORIES, AND IMAGININGS THAT CAME TO HIM.
INDEPENDENT OF THAT POSITION IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF WERE THE JOYFUL
HARDER HIS POSITION BECAME AND THE MORE TERRIBLE THE FUTURE, THE MORE
HAVE TO SHARE THAT FATE. STILL LESS DID PIERRE THINK ABOUT HIMSELF. THE
THINK OF KARATAEV WHO GREW WEAKER EVERY DAY AND EVIDENTLY WOULD SOON

HE DID NOT SEE AND DID NOT HEAR HOW THEY SHOT THE PRISONERS WHO LAGGED

SUPERFLUOUS STEAM TO BLOW OFF WHEN THE PRESSURE EXCEEDS A CERTAIN LIMIT.

SAVING POWER HE HAS OF TRANSFERRING HIS ATTENTION FROM ONE THING
ONLY NOW DID PIERRE REALIZE THE FULL STRENGTH OF LIFE IN MAN AND THE

BUT THOUGHT OF OTHER THINGS.
TERRIBLE TO LOOK AT THAN BEFORE. HOWEVER, HE DID NOT LOOK AT THEM NOW,
WALKED WITHOUT FEELING THE PAIN, THOUGH AT NIGHT HIS FEET WERE MORE
EVERYBODY GOT UP HE WENT ALONG, LIMPING, AND, WHEN HE HAD WARMED UP,

AFTER THE SECOND DAY'S MARCH PIERRE, HAVING EXAMINED HIS FEET BY THE

THE ONE THING THAT WAS AT FIRST HARD TO BEAR WAS HIS FEET.
THERE WERE THE CAMPFIRES; THE LICE THAT DEVOURED HIM WARMED HIS BODY.)
NO GREAT COLD, IT WAS ALWAYS WARM WALKING IN THE DAYTIME, AND AT NIGHT
THE GUNPOWDER THEY USED INSTEAD OF SALT WAS EVEN PLEASANT; THERE WAS

SUBSEQUENTLY TERMED HIS SUFFERINGS, BUT WHICH AT THE TIME HE SCARCELY
WHEN THEY LOCKED HIM UP AT NIGHT IN A STABLE. OF ALL THAT HE HIMSELF
WILL AS IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM--HE HAD BEEN NO MORE FREE THAN NOW
PIECES. HE DISCOVERED THAT WHEN HE HAD MARRIED HIS WIFE--OF HIS OWN FREE
THAT WERE COVERED WITH SORES--HIS FOOTGEAR HAVING LONG SINCE FALLEN TO
SHOES HE HAD SUFFERED JUST AS HE DID NOW WHEN HE WALKED WITH BARE FEET
WHILE THE OTHER WAS WARMING; AND THAT WHEN HE HAD PUT ON TIGHT DANCING
HE NOW, SLEEPING ON THE BARE DAMP EARTH WITH ONE SIDE GROWING CHILLED
PERSON IN A BED OF ROSES WITH ONE CRUMPLED PETAL SUFFERED AS KEENLY AS
HAVE THEIR LIMITS AND THAT THOSE LIMITS ARE VERY NEAR TOGETHER; THAT THE
NEED BE UNHAPPY AND LACK FREEDOM. HE LEARNED THAT SUFFERING AND FREEDOM
CAN BE HAPPY AND ENTIRELY FREE, SO THERE IS NO CONDITION IN WHICH HE
IS TERRIBLE. HE HAD LEARNED THAT AS THERE IS NO CONDITION IN WHICH MAN
LEARNED STILL ANOTHER NEW, CONSOLATORY TRUTH--THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD
SUPERFLUITY. AND NOW DURING THESE LAST THREE WEEKS OF THE MARCH HE HAD
HUMAN NEEDS, AND THAT ALL UNHAPPINESS ARISES NOT FROM PRIVATION BUT FROM
HAPPINESS, THAT HAPPINESS IS WITHIN HIM, IN THE SATISFACTION OF SIMPLE
BUT WITH HIS WHOLE BEING, BY LIFE ITSELF, THAT MAN IS CREATED FOR

MOVED FARTHER AWAY AND DID NOT THINK ABOUT HIM.
THE ODOR EMANATING FROM HIM WHICH WAS NOW STRONGER THAN BEFORE, PIERRE
KARATAEV GENERALLY LAY DOWN AT THE HALTING PLACES, AND WHEN HE SMELLED
GO NEAR HIM. WHEN HE DID SO AND HEARD THE SUBDUED MOANING WITH WHICH
SINCE KARATAEV HAD BEGUN TO GROW WEAKER IT HAD COST HIM AN EFFORT TO
GRADUALLY WEAKER PIERRE KEPT AWAY FROM HIM. PIERRE DID NOT KNOW WHY, BUT
FEVER HE HAD SUFFERED FROM IN THE HOSPITAL IN MOSCOW, AND AS HE GREW
ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER LEAVING MOSCOW KARATAEV AGAIN FELL ILL WITH THE

PEASANT OF HIS PARTY, TO SHAMSHEVO TO TRY AND SEIZE AT LEAST ONE OF THE
PUTTING THE WHOLE COLUMN ON THE ALERT, SO HE SENT TIKHON SHCHERBATY, A
DENISOV CONSIDERED IT DANGEROUS TO MAKE A SECOND ATTACK FOR FEAR OF

COULD TELL THEM NOTHING DEFINITE ABOUT THE TROOPS IN THAT COLUMN.
LITTLE DRUMMER BOY HAD BEEN TAKEN ALIVE, AND AS HE WAS A STRAGGLER HE
HASTILY THAT THE FRENCHMEN WITH THE WAGONS HAD ALL BEEN KILLED; ONLY A
THE ENEMY COLUMN. THAT MORNING'S ATTACK ON THE WAGONS HAD BEEN MADE SO
AND TO LEARN THAT HE HAD TO CAPTURE A "TONGUE"--THAT IS, A MAN FROM
DETER DENISOV. ALL THAT HE NOW WANTED TO KNOW WAS WHAT TROOPS THESE WERE
DOLOKHOV MIGHT HAVE AS MANY MORE, BUT THE DISPARITY OF NUMBERS DID NOT
THAT THE CONVOY HAD FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN. DENISOV HAD TWO HUNDRED, AND
FIND OUT AT WHAT DISTANCE THERE WERE OTHER FRENCH TROOPS. THEY RECKONED
BEYOND SHAMSHEVO, DOLOKHOV WAS TO OBSERVE THE ROAD IN THE SAME WAY, TO

COLUMNS OF FRENCH SHOULD SHOW THEMSELVES.
RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD, SIX COSSACKS WERE POSTED TO REPORT IF ANY FRESH
IN THEIR REAR, MORE THAN A MILE FROM MIKULINO WHERE THE FOREST CAME

THEM ALL AT ONE BLOW.
LIKE AN AVALANCHE ON THEIR HEADS FROM TWO SIDES, AND ROUT AND CAPTURE
LESS THAN A MILE FROM SHAMSHEVO, TO SURPRISE THE FRENCH AT DAWN, FALLING
TO COME THAT EVENING TO A CONSULTATION AT A WATCHMAN'S HUT IN THE FOREST
QUIETLY WITHOUT ALARMING THEM AND THEN, AFTER JOINING DOLOKHOV WHO WAS
WITHOUT ATTACKING. IT WAS NECESSARY TO LET THE FRENCH REACH SHAMSHEVO
AND UNTIL EVENING, THE PARTY HAD WATCHED THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FRENCH
FAR FROM MIKULINO WHERE THE FOREST RAN CLOSE TO THE ROAD. SINCE THEN,
TWO WAGONS LOADED WITH CAVALRY SADDLES, WHICH HAD STUCK IN THE MUD NOT
COSSACKS OF DENISOV'S PARTY HAD SEIZED AND CARRIED OFF INTO THE FOREST
EDGE, BUT NEVER LOSING SIGHT OF THE MOVING FRENCH. THAT MORNING,
SOMETIMES KEEPING WELL BACK IN THEM AND SOMETIMES COMING TO THE VERY
FROM IT. THROUGH THESE FORESTS DENISOV AND HIS PARTY RODE ALL DAY,
SOME PLACES UP TO THE ROAD ITSELF THOUGH IN OTHERS A MILE OR MORE BACK
BETWEEN MIKULINO AND SHAMSHEVO THERE WERE LARGE FORESTS, EXTENDING IN
THE VILLAGE OF MIKULINO TO THAT OF SHAMSHEVO. TO THE LEFT OF THE ROAD
CONVOY WITH THEIR OWN SMALL FORCES. ON OCTOBER 22 IT WAS MOVING FROM
REPORTING MATTERS TO THE HIGHER COMMAND, TO ATTACK AND SEIZE THAT
HAVING ARRANGED MATTERS THUS, DENISOV AND DOLOKHOV INTENDED, WITHOUT

HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE GERMAN.
GENERAL. TO THE POLISH GENERAL HE REPLIED TO THE SAME EFFECT, INFORMING
THAT PLEASURE BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE POLISH
DESIRE TO SERVE UNDER SO VALIANT AND RENOWNED A GENERAL, HE HAD TO FORGO
THESE DOCUMENTS, AND HE WROTE TO THE GERMAN THAT, DESPITE HIS HEARTFELT
"NO, BWOTHER, I HAVE GWOWN MUSTACHES MYSELF," SAID DENISOV ON READING

DIVISIONS TO ATTACK THE CONVOY.
TO DENISOV ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY, REQUESTING HIM TO JOIN UP WITH THEIR
OF LARGE PARTIES--ONE A POLE AND THE OTHER A GERMAN--SENT INVITATIONS
EXPRESSED IT, WERE SHARPENING THEIR TEETH FOR IT. TWO OF THE COMMANDERS

A SMALL PARTY AND MOVED IN DENISOV'S VICINITY), THE COMMANDERS OF SOME
STRONG ESCORT TO SMOLENSK. BESIDES DENISOV AND DOLOKHOV (WHO ALSO LED

ACCORDING TO RULES AT A DISTANCE FROM THE FRENCH, STILL REGARDED MANY

CLEAR TO ALL WHAT COULD BE VENTURED AGAINST THE FRENCH AND WHAT COULD
OF OCTOBER THIS KIND OF WARFARE HAD TAKEN DEFINITE SHAPE: IT HAD BECOME
HARDLY DARING TO DISMOUNT AND ALWAYS EXPECTING TO BE PURSUED. BY THE END
AND CAPTURED BY THE FRENCH, AND HID IN THE FORESTS WITHOUT UNSADDLING,
AMAZED AT THEIR OWN BOLDNESS, FEARED EVERY MINUTE TO BE SURROUNDED

FRENCH.

CAPTURED SEVERAL HUNDRED PRISONERS IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH; AND THERE
LANDOWNERS THAT REMAINED UNKNOWN. A SACRISTAN COMMANDED ONE PARTY WHICH
ALSO SMALL SCRATCH GROUPS OF FOOT AND HORSE, AND GROUPS OF PEASANTS AND
COMFORTS OF LIFE. OTHERS CONSISTED SOLELY OF COSSACK CAVALRY. THERE WERE
ALL THE ARMY METHODS AND HAD INFANTRY, ARTILLERY, STAFFS, AND THE
COMPANIES, OF VARIOUS SIZES AND CHARACTERS. THERE WERE SOME THAT ADOPTED
THE FRENCH WERE FLEEING TOWARD SMOLENSK, THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF SUCH
FRENCH ARMY--AND SOMETIMES SHOOK THAT TREE ITSELF. BY OCTOBER, WHEN
FALLEN LEAVES THAT DROPPED OF THEMSELVES FROM THAT WITHERED TREE--THE
THE IRREGULARS DESTROYED THE GREAT ARMY PIECEMEAL. THEY GATHERED THE

NUMEROUS THESE DETACHMENTS BECAME.
OTHERS WERE RECOGNIZED. THE FURTHER THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSED THE MORE

DESTROYED THE FRENCH, AND TO HIM BELONGS THE CREDIT FOR TAKING THE FIRST

ANY COMPULSION TO INDUCE THEM TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO HARDSHIPS AND
INDIVIDUALS, WITHOUT ORDERS, DEALT BLOWS AT THE FRENCH WITHOUT NEEDING
INTO SMALL UNITS, BECAUSE THEIR SPIRIT HAD SO RISEN THAT SEPARATE
TO TACTICS TO HAVE ATTACKED IN MASS, BUT IN FACT THEY SPLIT UP
HELD THE ARMY TOGETHER. THE RUSSIANS, ON THE CONTRARY, OUGHT ACCORDING
A MASS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF THE ARMY HAD SO FALLEN THAT ONLY THE MASS
HAVE SEPARATED INTO DETACHMENTS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES--CONGREGATED INTO
THE FRENCH, RETREATING IN 1812--THOUGH ACCORDING TO TACTICS THEY SHOULD

FALL IN THE SPIRIT OF THE TROOPS OCCURS, AS IN ALL NATIONAL WARS.

COMPASSION.
RESENTMENT AND REVENGE IN THEIR SOUL YIELDS TO A FEELING OF CONTEMPT AND
CUDGEL THAT COMES TO HAND AND STRIKE WITH IT TILL THE FEELING OF

CONQUEROR, BUT AT THE MOMENT OF TRIAL, WITHOUT ASKING WHAT RULES OTHERS
OF THEIR RAPIER GRACEFULLY AND POLITELY, HAND IT TO THEIR MAGNANIMOUS

AND IT IS WELL FOR A PEOPLE WHO DO NOT--AS THE FRENCH DID IN

TILL THE WHOLE INVASION HAD PERISHED.
FELL WITH STUPID SIMPLICITY, BUT CONSISTENTLY, AND BELABORED THE FRENCH
ANYONE'S TASTES OR RULES AND REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING ELSE, IT ROSE AND
WITH ALL ITS MENACING AND MAJESTIC STRENGTH, AND WITHOUT CONSULTING
THRUST EN PRIME, AND SO ON--THE CUDGEL OF THE PEOPLE'S WAR WAS LIFTED
QUARTE OR EN TIERCE ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES, AND TO MAKE AN ADROIT
DISGRACEFUL TO FIGHT WITH A CUDGEL AND THEY WANTED TO ASSUME A POSE EN
SPITE OF THE FACT THAT TO SOME HIGHLY PLACED RUSSIANS IT SEEMED RATHER
THE COMPLAINTS OF THE FRENCH AS TO THE NONOBSERVANCE OF THE RULES, IN
THE RULES--AS IF THERE WERE ANY RULES FOR KILLING PEOPLE. IN SPITE OF
THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER THAT THE WAR WAS BEING CARRIED ON CONTRARY TO ALL
RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD, HE DID NOT CEASE TO COMPLAIN TO KUTUZOV AND TO
ATTITUDE IN MOSCOW AND INSTEAD OF HIS OPPONENT'S RAPIER SAW A CUDGEL
NAPOLEON FELT THIS, AND FROM THE TIME HE TOOK UP THE CORRECT FENCING

TRANSPORTS, AND THE GUERRILLA WAR WERE ALL DEPARTURES FROM THE RULES.
RETREAT, THE BURNING OF MOSCOW, THE CAPTURE OF MARAUDERS, THE SEIZURE OF
RETREATS AFTER BATTLES, THE BLOW DEALT AT BORODINO AND THE RENEWED
PREVIOUS TRADITIONS OF WAR. THE BURNING OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES, THE
AFTER THE BURNING OF SMOLENSK A WAR BEGAN WHICH DID NOT FOLLOW ANY

THE EVENT.
ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF FENCING ARE THE HISTORIANS WHO HAVE DESCRIBED
THE CUDGEL WAS THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE; THOSE WHO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE MATTER
THE FRENCH ARMY; HIS OPPONENT WHO THREW AWAY THE RAPIER AND SNATCHED UP
THE FENCER WHO DEMANDED A CONTEST ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF FENCING WAS

CONFUSION AND OBSCURITY WOULD RESULT FROM SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF THE DUEL.
WITH THE RAPIER ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF ART. ONE CAN IMAGINE WHAT
CONCEAL THE FACTS OF THE CASE, INSISTED THAT HE HAD GAINED HIS VICTORY
AT THE SAME TIME INFLUENCED BY TRADITIONS OF CHIVALRY AND, DESIRING TO
SO SENSIBLY EMPLOYED THE BEST AND SIMPLEST MEANS TO ATTAIN HIS END WAS
HAND BEGINS TO BRANDISH IT. THEN LET US IMAGINE THAT THE COMBATANT WHO

IT PROVED THAT THE FORCE WHICH DECIDES THE FATE OF PEOPLES LIES NOT IN
PRODUCE A CONQUEST AND IS NOT EVEN AN INVARIABLE INDICATION OF CONQUEST;

OF TROOPS TOOK PART, WE MIGHT TREAT IT AS AN EXCEPTION; BUT THIS EVENT
IF THE MATTER CONCERNED SOME BRIEF CONFLICT IN WHICH ONLY A SMALL NUMBER
HISTORIANS' USUAL EXPEDIENT WHEN ANYTHING DOES NOT FIT THEIR STANDARDS);
WE MIGHT SAY THAT IT WAS NOT AN HISTORIC PHENOMENON (WHICH IS THE
DOES THIS MEAN? IF IT WERE AN EXAMPLE TAKEN FROM THE HISTORY OF CHINA,
ANY THAT WERE AT ALL SERIOUS, YET THE FRENCH ARMY CEASED TO EXIST. WHAT
AFTER THE FRENCH VICTORY AT BORODINO THERE WAS NO GENERAL ENGAGEMENT NOR

THAT DESTROYED NAPOLEON'S ARMY, IS IMPOSSIBLE.

WHY THE DEFEAT OF AN ARMY--A HUNDREDTH PART OF A NATION--SHOULD OBLIGE
DECREASE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE NATION--EVEN THOUGH IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE
IS THE CAUSE, OR AT LEAST AN ESSENTIAL INDICATION, OF AN INCREASE OR
STATEMENT THAT THE GREATER OR LESSER SUCCESS OF ONE ARMY AGAINST ANOTHER
THE FACTS OF HISTORY (AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT) CONFIRM THE TRUTH OF THE

ARMY, GAINS A VICTORY BY KILLING THREE, FIVE, OR TEN THOUSAND MEN, AND
HAVING QUARRELED WITH ANOTHER, COLLECTS AN ARMY, FIGHTS HIS ENEMY'S
STRANGE AS MAY BE THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF HOW SOME KING OR EMPEROR,

OF STATES AND NATIONS INCREASES OR DECREASES.
DIRECT RESULT OF GREATER OR LESS SUCCESS IN WAR THE POLITICAL STRENGTH
IN THEIR CONFLICTS WITH ONE ANOTHER IS EXPRESSED IN WARS, AND THAT AS A
ALL HISTORIANS AGREE THAT THE EXTERNAL ACTIVITY OF STATES AND NATIONS

MOST INSTRUCTIVE PHENOMENA IN HISTORY.

"WHO BROUGHT IT?" ASKED KUTUZOV WITH A LOOK WHICH, WHEN THE CANDLE WAS

OF THE NEWS.
WHILE A FOOTMAN WAS LIGHTING A CANDLE, TOLL COMMUNICATED THE SUBSTANCE

OUT TO THEM.
"EH, WHO'S THERE? COME IN, COME IN! WHAT NEWS?" THE FIELD MARSHAL CALLED

KONOVNITSYN, AND BOLKHOVITINOV.
THERE WAS A STIR IN THE NEXT ROOM AND HE HEARD THE STEPS OF TOLL,

DURING ITS FIRST ELEVEN DAYS AFTER LEAVING MOSCOW: A STAMPEDE WHICH MADE
WHAT HAPPENED--THE INSANE, CONVULSIVE STAMPEDE OF NAPOLEON'S ARMY
THROUGH MEDYN AND YUKHNOV, BUT THE ONE THING HE COULD NOT FORESEE WAS
AWAITING HIM. KUTUZOV EVEN IMAGINED THAT NAPOLEON'S ARMY MIGHT TURN BACK
NAPOLEON MIGHT FIGHT HIM WITH HIS OWN WEAPON AND REMAIN IN MOSCOW
HE THOUGHT TOO OF THE POSSIBILITY (WHICH HE FEARED MOST OF ALL) THAT

DRAWN WITH KUTUZOV; AND HOW THEY WOULD MAKE SUGGESTIONS, QUARREL, ISSUE
ESPECIALLY BENNIGSEN, WHO EVER SINCE TARUTINO HAD BEEN AT DAGGERS
OF INFLUENTIAL MEN ON THE STAFF WOULD BE STIRRED UP BY THIS NEWS,
THE UNPLEASANT THOUGHT THAT OCCURRED TO HIM, OF HOW ALL THAT NEST

DOOR OPEN, GIVING ORDERS THAT EVERY MESSENGER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO WAKE
SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT AS GENERAL ON DUTY HE HAD ALWAYS SLEPT WITH HIS
BATTLE BUT WAS ALWAYS FOUND WHERE THE SITUATION WAS MOST DIFFICULT.
CAPACITY AND INFORMATION, AND LIKE DOKHTUROV HE NEVER MADE PLANS OF
LIKE DOKHTUROV HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A MAN OF VERY LIMITED
1812--THE BARCLAYS, RAEVSKIS, ERMOLOVS, PLATOVS, AND MILORADOVICHES.
MERELY FOR PROPRIETY'S SAKE IN THE LIST OF THE SO-CALLED HEROES OF
PETER PETROVICH KONOVNITSYN, LIKE DOKHTUROV, SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN INCLUDED

AND HE DID HIS WORK, GIVING HIS WHOLE STRENGTH TO THE TASK.
AND STILL LESS SPEAK ABOUT IT, BUT MUST ONLY ATTEND TO ONE'S OWN WORK.
CONVICTION THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL, BUT THAT ONE MUST NOT TRUST TO THIS
REASON BUT BY SOMETHING ELSE. THERE WAS WITHIN HIM A DEEP UNEXPRESSED

WHILE LISTENING TO THE OFFICER'S REPORT KONOVNITSYN BROKE THE SEAL AND

BLINKING AT THE LIGHT.
"WELL, WHAT IS IT? FROM WHOM?" HE ASKED IMMEDIATELY BUT WITHOUT HURRY,

ITS HABITUAL CALM AND FIRM APPEARANCE.
FROM PRESENT AFFAIRS, BUT THEN HE SUDDENLY STARTED AND HIS FACE ASSUMED
THERE STILL REMAINED FOR AN INSTANT A FARAWAY DREAMY EXPRESSION REMOTE

AND IN FACT THE HEAD IN THE NIGHTCAP WAS LIFTED AT ONCE. ON

WHEN THE FLAME OF THE SULPHUR SPLINTERS KINDLED BY THE TINDER BURNED

AS HE HELD THE CANDLE, AND THE FACE OF ANOTHER MAN WHO WAS STILL ASLEEP.

"HERE IS THE DISPATCH," SAID BOLKHOVITINOV. "MY ORDERS ARE TO GIVE IT AT

"FROM DOKHTUROV AND FROM ALEXEY PETROVICH. NAPOLEON IS AT FORMINSK,"

"WHAT? WHAT'S THAT? FROM WHOM?" CAME A SLEEPY VOICE.

"YOUR HONOR, YOUR HONOR! A COURIER."

ONE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. DISMOUNTING AT A COTTAGE ON WHOSE WATTLE FENCE

HAVING CHANGED HORSES TWICE AND GALLOPED TWENTY MILES IN AN HOUR AND A

THAT TIME AND NOW THE WHOLE FRENCH ARMY WAS THERE. ERMOLOV WISHED TO ACT

ANY ACTION, AS IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO HIM NOW WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO. HE HAD

DUBIOUSLY. AND THIS SILENCE ABOUT DOKHTUROV IS THE CLEAREST TESTIMONY TO
CAMPAIGN, BUT OF DOKHTUROV NOTHING OR VERY LITTLE IS SAID AND THAT
AND WE ARE TOLD OF MANY GENIUSES AND HEROES OF THAT PERIOD OF THE

GREATEST GLORY OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY. MANY HEROES HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED TO
AND THE QUIET LITTLE DOKHTUROV RODE THITHER, AND BORODINO BECAME THE
RECTIFY A MISTAKE HE HAD MADE BY SENDING SOMEONE ELSE THERE FIRST.
THIS SAME IRRESOLUTE AND UNDISCERNING DOKHTUROV--KUTUZOV HASTENING TO
FRENCH ARTILLERY FIRE WAS DIRECTED AGAINST IT, THE MAN SENT THERE WAS
TENTHS OF THE MEN OF OUR LEFT FLANK HAD FALLEN AND THE FULL FORCE OF THE

GUARD. ILL WITH FEVER HE WENT TO SMOLENSK WITH TWENTY THOUSAND MEN
WERE FLYING AND PERISHING AND NOT A SINGLE GENERAL WAS LEFT IN THE REAR
AUGEZD DAM, RALLYING THE REGIMENTS, SAVING WHAT WAS POSSIBLE WHEN ALL

DIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT ONE, WAS ENTRUSTED TO DOKHTUROV--THAT SAME

SENT TO FORMINSK TO ATTACK BROUSSIER.
THE RESULT WAS A COMPROMISE WHICH WAS INEVITABLE: A SMALL DETACHMENT WAS
DOROKHOV'S SUGGESTION. KUTUZOV DID NOT CONSIDER ANY OFFENSIVE NECESSARY.
MEMORY OF THE EASY VICTORY AT TARUTINO, URGED KUTUZOV TO CARRY OUT
OFFICERS AGAIN DEMANDED ACTION. GENERALS ON THE STAFF, EXCITED BY THE
REST OF THE FRENCH ARMY THEY MIGHT EASILY BE DESTROYED. THE SOLDIERS AND

TRY TO ESCAPE THAT FORCE, TO ADDRESS ENTREATIES OR EXHORTATIONS TO THOSE

FROM THE TIME HE ENTERED MOSCOW TILL THE TIME HE LEFT IT. THE ABSENCE
ELSEWHERE. ORDER AFTER ORDER AND PLAN AFTER PLAN WERE ISSUED BY HIM
HIS ACTIVITY IN MOSCOW WAS AS AMAZING AND AS FULL OF GENIUS AS

MATTER PLAINLY AND SIMPLY, AND WE WILL NOT ABANDON THAT RIGHT.
IN ORDER TO HIDE OUR SHAME. WE HAVE PAID FOR THE RIGHT TO LOOK AT THE
IN GERMANY. BUT WE, THANK GOD, HAVE NO NEED TO RECOGNIZE HIS GENIUS
TO RECOGNIZE HIS GENIUS AS THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF THE WAR CARRIED ON
WITHOUT FIGHTING AND OF FORTRESSES WITHOUT A SIEGE MUST INCLINE GERMANS
OR GERMAN SOURCES, AND THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE SURRENDER OF WHOLE CORPS
IN AUSTRIA OR PRUSSIA, FOR WE HAVE TO DRAW OUR INFORMATION FROM FRENCH
ARE ALL TOLD US BY FRENCHMEN. WE CANNOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE HIS GENIUS
CENTURIES LOOKED DOWN UPON HIS GRANDEUR--FOR HIS GREAT EXPLOITS THERE
KNOW FOR CERTAIN IN HOW FAR HIS GENIUS WAS GENUINE IN EGYPT--WHERE FORTY
THAN IT WAS IN EGYPT, IN ITALY, IN AUSTRIA, AND IN PRUSSIA. WE DO NOT
SUBSEQUENTLY IN 1813. HIS ACTIVITY AT THAT TIME WAS NO LESS ASTOUNDING
COULD FOR HIMSELF AND HIS ARMY, AS HE HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY AND AS HE DID
HIS ACTIONS. HE EMPLOYED ALL HIS ABILITY AND STRENGTH TO DO THE BEST HE
WEAKENED IN MOSCOW, AND DO SO ONLY BECAUSE THE RESULTS DID NOT JUSTIFY
THE HISTORIANS QUITE FALSELY REPRESENT NAPOLEON'S FACULTIES AS HAVING

GUIDED THE EVENT.
PERSONAL ACTIVITY OF ANY SOLDIER, MERELY COINCIDED WITH THE LAWS THAT
IN BOTH CASES HIS PERSONAL ACTIVITY, HAVING NO MORE FORCE THAN THE

WISHED TO AND BECAUSE HE WAS VERY CLEVER AND A GENIUS.
UNJUST AS TO SAY THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TROOPS TO MOSCOW BECAUSE HE
ARMY BECAUSE HE WISHED TO, OR BECAUSE HE WAS VERY STUPID, WOULD BE AS
NAPOLEON, THE MAN OF GENIUS, DID THIS! BUT TO SAY THAT HE DESTROYED HIS

INDEPENDENTLY OF ANYTHING THE RUSSIAN ARMY MIGHT DO.
OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SO COMPLETELY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT PURPOSE,
THE MOST SKILLFUL STRATEGIST COULD HARDLY HAVE DEVISED ANY SERIES
ARMY, AS THE SEQUEL SHOWED. HAD NAPOLEON'S AIM BEEN TO DESTROY HIS ARMY,
STUPID THAN THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DEVISED, OR MORE DISASTROUS FOR THE
INSTEAD TO MOZHAYSK ALONG THE DEVASTATED SMOLENSK ROAD. NOTHING MORE
ATTEMPTING TO BREAK THROUGH AND TAKE THE ROAD KUTUZOV TOOK, BUT RETIRING
TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND REACHED MALO-YAROSLAVETS, AGAIN WITHOUT
HIM, HE QUITTED MOSCOW, APPROACHED KUTUZOV WITHOUT JOINING BATTLE,
PLUNDER THE CITY; THEN, HESITATING WHETHER TO LEAVE A GARRISON BEHIND
ACTUALLY DID. HE REMAINED IN MOSCOW TILL OCTOBER, LETTING THE TROOPS
TOOK), NOTHING MORE STUPID OR DISASTROUS CAN BE IMAGINED THAN WHAT HE
NORTHERLY OR MORE SOUTHERLY ROUTE (SAY BY THE ROAD KUTUZOV AFTERWARDS
ADVANCING ON PETERSBURG OR ON NIZHNI-NOVGOROD, OR RETIRING BY A MORE
TO HIM. OF ALL THAT NAPOLEON MIGHT HAVE DONE: WINTERING IN MOSCOW,
POWER TO SELECT THE MOST FOOLISH AND RUINOUS OF ALL THE COURSES OPEN
HE NOT MERELY DID NOTHING OF THE KIND, BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE USED HIS

THE ARMY, TOOK NONE OF THESE STEPS.
THAT GREATEST OF ALL GENIUSES, WHO THE HISTORIANS DECLARE HAD CONTROL OF
ENOUGH IN MOSCOW TO SUPPLY THE WHOLE ARMY FOR SIX MONTHS. YET NAPOLEON,
THE PROVISIONS, OF WHICH (ACCORDING TO THE FRENCH HISTORIANS) THERE WERE
SUFFICIENT IN MOSCOW FOR THE WHOLE ARMY--AND METHODICALLY TO COLLECT
THE TROOPS TO LOOT, TO PREPARE WINTER CLOTHING--OF WHICH THERE WAS
FOR THAT, ONLY VERY SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS WERE NECESSARY: NOT TO ALLOW
REQUIRED TO RETAIN THE BRILLIANT POSITION THE FRENCH HELD AT THAT TIME.
VILNA; OR REMAIN IN MOSCOW; IN SHORT, NO SPECIAL GENIUS WOULD SEEM TO BE
PETERSBURG, OR EVEN, IN THE CASE OF A REVERSE, RETURN TO SMOLENSK OR
AN ADVANTAGEOUS PEACE, OR IN CASE OF A REFUSAL MAKE A MENACING MOVE ON
ON THE RUSSIAN ARMY WITH DOUBLE ITS STRENGTH AND DESTROY IT; NEGOTIATE
A WHOLE MONTH. NAPOLEON'S POSITION IS MOST BRILLIANT. HE CAN EITHER FALL
THE STRENGTH OF THE FRENCH, DOES NOT MAKE A SINGLE ATTEMPT TO ATTACK FOR
INCALCULABLE WEALTH, IS IN NAPOLEON'S HANDS. THE RUSSIAN ARMY, ONLY HALF
CAPITAL. MOSCOW, ABOUNDING IN PROVISIONS, ARMS, MUNITIONS, AND
HANDS OF THE FRENCH. THE RUSSIANS RETREAT AND ABANDON THEIR ANCIENT
CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE VICTORY FOR THE BATTLEFIELD REMAINS IN THE
NAPOLEON ENTERS MOSCOW AFTER THE BRILLIANT VICTORY DE LA MOSKOWA; THERE

NAPOLEON'S ARMY HAD ONLY AWAITED TO BEGIN ITS FLIGHT.
THE WEAKNESS OF THE FRENCH, AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT SHOCK WHICH
WERE ATTAINED: THE TRANSITION FROM RETREAT TO ADVANCE, AN EXPOSURE OF
GREATEST CONFUSION, THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS OF THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN
BATTLE. WITH A MINIMUM OF EFFORT AND INSIGNIFICANT LOSSES, DESPITE THE
IMAGINE ANY RESULT MORE OPPORTUNE THAN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THIS
STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND EVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO
JUST BECAUSE OF ITS INCONGRUITIES, WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS WANTED AT THAT
AND DESTROY THEIR ARMY--IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE BATTLE OF TARUTINO,
ALL THE RUSSIANS OF THAT DAY DESIRED--TO DRIVE THE FRENCH OUT OF RUSSIA
SO ON. BUT IF THE AIM OF THE BATTLE WAS WHAT ACTUALLY RESULTED AND WHAT
HIMSELF; NOR THAT OF THE COSSACK WHO WANTED MORE BOOTY THAN HE GOT, AND
THE AIM OF THE OFFICER WHO WISHED TO GO INTO ACTION TO DISTINGUISH
THE WHOLE CORPS, WHICH BENNIGSEN AND OTHERS MAY HAVE HAD IN VIEW; NOR
VIEW--TO TAKE MURAT PRISONER; NOR THE RESULT OF IMMEDIATELY DESTROYING
DISPOSITIONS; NOR THAT WHICH COUNT ORLOV-DENISOV MAY HAVE HAD IN
VIEW--TO LEAD THE TROOPS INTO ACTION IN THE ORDER PRESCRIBED BY THE

WE OURSELVES SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO, JUST AS PEOPLE SPEAK TODAY. BUT

AND FOLLOWING THE BATTLE FRESH CHANGES WERE MADE IN THE STAFF.
RECEIVED PLEASANT RECOGNITIONS CORRESPONDING TO THEIR VARIOUS GRADES,
AND BENNIGSEN SOME DIAMONDS AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBLES, OTHERS ALSO
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BATTLE KUTUZOV RECEIVED A DIAMOND DECORATION,

THE REST OF THE ARMY MERELY LOST SOME HUNDREDS OF MEN USELESSLY.
THE WHOLE BATTLE CONSISTED IN WHAT ORLOV-DENISOV'S COSSACKS HAD DONE:

HALTED FOR THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR.
WERE IN RETREAT HE ORDERED AN ADVANCE, THOUGH AT EVERY HUNDRED PACES HE
KUTUZOV DID NOT REPLY, BUT WHEN THEY REPORTED TO HIM THAT MURAT'S TROOPS

YOU WERE TO ORDER AN ATTACK! IF NOT, THE GUARDS WILL NOT SO MUCH AS SEE
"IT IS NOT TOO LATE YET, YOUR HIGHNESS--THE ENEMY HAS NOT GONE AWAY--IF

SOON AFTER THIS, ERMOLOV MOVED UP TO KUTUZOV AND RESPECTFULLY REMARKED:

WITH HIS KNEE RAEVSKI WHO WAS AT HIS SIDE.
"HE'S HAVING A LITTLE FUN AT MY EXPENSE," SAID ERMOLOV SOFTLY, NUDGING

WOULD CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THAT HINT.
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR HIM THE STORM HAD BLOWN OVER, AND THAT KUTUZOV
ERMOLOV SCREWED UP HIS EYES AND SMILED FAINTLY ON HEARING THESE WORDS.

FOREWARNED, TAKES MEASURES ACCORDINGLY."
BUT AS SOON AS ONE GETS TO BUSINESS NOTHING IS READY, AND THE ENEMY,
"YOU SEE! THEY ARE ASKING TO ATTACK AND MAKING PLANS OF ALL KINDS,

WAS BEHIND HIM AND TO WHOM HE HAD NOT SPOKEN SINCE THE PREVIOUS DAY.
NOW TWO BATTALIONS OF POLES, HE GAVE A SIDELONG GLANCE AT ERMOLOV WHO
THE REPORTS OF THE COSSACKS THERE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN NOBODY--THERE WERE
WHEN KUTUZOV WAS INFORMED THAT AT THE FRENCH REAR--WHERE ACCORDING TO

TIME, AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE NOW!" HE REPLIED TO SOMEONE ELSE.
"WE COULDN'T TAKE MURAT PRISONER THIS MORNING OR GET TO THE PLACE IN

ASKED PERMISSION TO ADVANCE.
UNABLE TO EXECUTE COMPLICATED MANEUVERS," SAID HE TO MILORADOVICH WHO
"THE WORD ATTACK IS ALWAYS ON YOUR TONGUE, BUT YOU DON'T SEE THAT WE ARE

HE RODE SILENTLY ON HIS SMALL GRAY HORSE, INDOLENTLY ANSWERING

FAR AS WAS IN HIS POWER HELD THE TROOPS BACK. HE DID NOT ADVANCE.
CONFUSION WOULD COME OF THIS BATTLE UNDERTAKEN AGAINST HIS WILL, AND AS
BUT KUTUZOV ACCOMPANIED THAT COLUMN. HE WELL KNEW THAT NOTHING BUT
MEANWHILE ANOTHER COLUMN WAS TO HAVE ATTACKED THE FRENCH FROM THE FRONT,

SOME TIME QUITE USELESSLY.
BULLETS KILLED MANY OF HIS MEN. AND HIS DIVISION REMAINED UNDER FIRE FOR

"I PREFER NOT TO TAKE LESSONS FROM ANYONE, BUT I CAN DIE WITH MY MEN AS

NATASHA, SHE SAW THE TERRIBLE MORAL SYMPTOMS WHICH TO HER WERE MORE
ASSUMED A MALIGNANT CHARACTER, BUT WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID DID NOT INTEREST
ARRIVAL. FROM THAT DAY, AS THE DOCTOR EXPRESSED IT, THE WASTING FEVER
THAT WAS WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM TWO DAYS BEFORE PRINCESS MARY'S

HER STRANGELY, NOT UNDERSTANDING.
UP AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER. HE DID NOT ANSWER AND LOOKED AT
WHEN, WAKING IN A COLD PERSPIRATION, HE MOVED ON THE DIVAN, NATASHA WENT

STRANGE LIGHTNESS DID NOT AGAIN LEAVE HIM.
AS IF POWERS TILL THEN CONFINED WITHIN HIM HAD BEEN LIBERATED, AND THAT
THEN CONCEALED THE UNKNOWN WAS LIFTED FROM HIS SPIRITUAL VISION. HE FELT
AND ALL AT ONCE IT GREW LIGHT IN HIS SOUL AND THE VEIL THAT HAD TILL
"YES, IT WAS DEATH! I DIED--AND WOKE UP. YES, DEATH IS AN AWAKENING!"

AND AT THE VERY INSTANT HE DIED, HAVING MADE AN EFFORT, HE AWOKE.
BUT AT THE INSTANT HE DIED, PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS ASLEEP,

DEATH, AND PRINCE ANDREW DIED.
AND BOTH HALVES OF THE DOOR NOISELESSLY OPENED. IT ENTERED, AND IT WAS
ONCE AGAIN IT PUSHED FROM OUTSIDE. HIS LAST SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS WERE VAIN

BEHIND BY THAT TERROR, OPENED AND CLOSED AGAIN.
POSSIBLE--BUT HIS EFFORTS WERE WEAK AND CLUMSY AND THE DOOR, PUSHED FROM
DOOR, MAKING A FINAL EFFORT TO HOLD IT BACK--TO LOCK IT WAS NO LONGER
BREAKING IN THROUGH THAT DOOR, AND HAD TO BE KEPT OUT. HE SEIZED THE
AGAINST IT AND FORCING ITS WAY IN. SOMETHING NOT HUMAN--DEATH--WAS
THE DOOR, THAT DREADFUL SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS ALREADY PRESSING
STOOD BEHIND THE DOOR. BUT JUST WHEN HE WAS CLUMSILY CREEPING TOWARD
WAS SEIZED BY AN AGONIZING FEAR. AND THAT FEAR WAS THE FEAR OF DEATH. IT
IN TIME TO LOCK THE DOOR THOUGH HE PAINFULLY STRAINED ALL HIS POWERS. HE
TRIED TO HURRY, BUT HIS LEGS REFUSED TO MOVE AND HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT BE
DEPENDED ON WHETHER HE WAS, OR WAS NOT, IN TIME TO LOCK IT. HE WENT, AND
ALL ELSE. HE ROSE AND WENT TO THE DOOR TO BOLT AND LOCK IT. EVERYTHING
DISAPPEAR AND A SINGLE QUESTION, THAT OF THE CLOSED DOOR, SUPERSEDED
EMPTY WITTICISMS. GRADUALLY, UNNOTICED, ALL THESE PERSONS BEGAN TO
MORE IMPORTANT CARES, BUT HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK, SURPRISING THEM BY
PRINCE ANDREW DIMLY REALIZED THAT ALL THIS WAS TRIVIAL AND THAT HE HAD
DISCUSSED SOMETHING TRIVIAL. THEY WERE PREPARING TO GO AWAY SOMEWHERE.
INSIGNIFICANT PEOPLE APPEARED BEFORE HIM. HE TALKED TO THEM AND
HE WAS QUITE WELL AND UNWOUNDED. MANY VARIOUS, INDIFFERENT, AND
HE DREAMED THAT HE WAS LYING IN THE ROOM HE REALLY WAS IN, BUT THAT

AGITATION AND OBSCURITY. HE FELL ASLEEP.

"LOVE? WHAT IS LOVE?" HE THOUGHT.

HE FELT HIMSELF NEARER TO IT.
ALWAYS OCCUPIED HIS MIND--ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH, AND CHIEFLY ABOUT DEATH.
AS HE FELL ASLEEP HE HAD STILL BEEN THINKING OF THE SUBJECT THAT NOW

SUDDENLY AWOKE WITH A START AND IN A COLD PERSPIRATION.
SOON HE REALLY SHUT HIS EYES AND FELL ASLEEP. HE DID NOT SLEEP LONG AND

STOCKING AND RESOLVED NOT TO TURN ROUND TILL IT WAS FINISHED.
HIM, AND HER EYES MET HIS BEAMING AT HER. SHE SET HERSELF A TASK ON HER
SAT DOWN AGAIN IN HER FORMER POSITION. TWICE SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT
HE PRESSED HER HAND AND RELEASED IT, AND SHE WENT BACK TO THE CANDLE AND

PLEASE!"
"BUT YOU HAVE NOT SLEPT," SHE SAID, REPRESSING HER JOY. "TRY TO SLEEP...

NOT DO AND THAT HE HAD TO BE QUIET.
NATASHA FELT HAPPY AND AGITATED, BUT AT ONCE REMEMBERED THAT THIS WOULD

"HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE!" AND TAKING HER HAND HE KISSED IT.

HE REMAINED SILENT AWHILE.

HANDS WITH A PASSIONATE MOVEMENT.
"I AM SURE OF IT, SURE!" NATASHA ALMOST SHOUTED, TAKING HOLD OF BOTH HIS

WHOLE SOUL--SHALL I LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
"WHY TOO MUCH?... WELL, WHAT DO YOU, WHAT DO YOU FEEL IN YOUR SOUL, YOUR

"AND I!"--SHE TURNED AWAY FOR AN INSTANT. "WHY TOO MUCH?" SHE ASKED.

"NATASHA, I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH! MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD."

NATASHA DREW CLOSER TO HIM. HER FACE SHONE WITH RAPTUROUS JOY.

I WANT TO WEEP FOR JOY."
ELSE GIVES ME THAT SENSE OF SOFT TRANQUILLITY THAT YOU DO... THAT LIGHT.
"NO, I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT YOU A LONG TIME. I FELT YOU COME IN. NO ONE

"YOU ARE NOT ASLEEP?"

AND BENT OVER HIM.
HIM, AND SUDDENLY, NOTICING HIS SHINING EYES, STEPPED LIGHTLY UP TO HIM
ON HEARING THAT SOUND NATASHA PUT DOWN THE STOCKING, LEANED NEARER TO

FROM A HABIT ACQUIRED DURING HIS SUFFERINGS.
AM I TO DO IF I LOVE HER?" HE THOUGHT, AND HE INVOLUNTARILY GROANED,
MY LIFE IN FALSITY? I LOVE HER MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD! BUT WHAT
TRUTH OF LIFE HAS BEEN REVEALED TO ME ONLY TO SHOW ME THAT I HAVE SPENT
ME TO HER SO STRANGELY ONLY FOR ME TO DIE?... IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE
LISTENED TO THE LIGHT CLICK OF THE STEEL NEEDLES. "CAN FATE HAVE BROUGHT

BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AGAIN, BUT AFTER THAT THEY NEVER SPOKE OF THE
HER THAT IF HE LIVED HE WOULD ALWAYS THANK GOD FOR HIS WOUND WHICH HAD
AT THE TROITSA MONASTERY THEY HAD SPOKEN OF THE PAST, AND HE HAD TOLD

CAUTIOUSLY.
DEEP BREATH AFTER STOOPING, BUT REFRAINED FROM DOING SO AND BREATHED
HE LOOKED AT HER WITHOUT MOVING AND SAW THAT SHE WANTED TO DRAW A

AND REGAINED HER FORMER POSITION.
STOOPED CAREFULLY WITH A SUPPLE AND EXACT MOVEMENT, PICKED UP THE BALL,
STARTED, GLANCED ROUND AT HIM, AND SCREENING THE CANDLE WITH HER HAND
OF HER DROOPING FACE. SHE MOVED, AND THE BALL ROLLED OFF HER KNEES. SHE
RAPIDLY MOVING HANDS, AND HE COULD CLEARLY SEE THE THOUGHTFUL PROFILE
THE KNITTING OF STOCKINGS. THE NEEDLES CLICKED LIGHTLY IN HER SLENDER,
NURSES WHO KNIT STOCKINGS, AND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING SOOTHING IN
ANDREW HAD CASUALLY MENTIONED THAT NO ONE NURSED THE SICK SO WELL AS OLD
KNITTING A STOCKING. SHE HAD LEARNED TO KNIT STOCKINGS SINCE PRINCE
PLACED SIDEWAYS, SCREENING THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE FROM HIM, AND WAS
PHYSICAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER NEARNESS. SHE WAS SITTING IN AN ARMCHAIR
SINCE SHE HAD BEGUN LOOKING AFTER HIM, HE HAD ALWAYS EXPERIENCED THIS

NOISELESSLY.
AND SO IT WAS: IN SONYA'S PLACE SAT NATASHA WHO HAD JUST COME IN

"AH, SHE HAS COME!" THOUGHT HE.

BEGAN TO DOZE. SUDDENLY A FEELING OF HAPPINESS SEIZED HIM.
THOUGHTS WERE PRETERNATURALLY CLEAR. SONYA WAS SITTING BY THE TABLE. HE
IT WAS EVENING. AS USUAL AFTER DINNER HE WAS SLIGHTLY FEVERISH, AND HIS

ULTIMATELY VANQUISHED, ATTACK OF TERROR BEFORE THE UNKNOWN.
PRESENTED TO HIM IN THE FORM OF HIS LOVE FOR NATASHA, AND A LAST, THOUGH
THE UNEXPECTED REALIZATION OF THE FACT THAT HE STILL VALUED LIFE AS
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH, IN WHICH DEATH GAINED THE VICTORY. IT WAS
DAYS BEFORE PRINCESS MARY ARRIVED. IT WAS THE LAST SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE
REFERRED TO WHEN SHE SAID: "THIS SUDDENLY HAPPENED," HAD OCCURRED TWO
HIS ILLNESS PURSUED ITS NORMAL PHYSICAL COURSE, BUT WHAT NATASHA

WHETHER KURAGIN WAS ALIVE. AND HE DARED NOT INQUIRE.
NOW REGAIN THE FEELING HE THEN HAD, BUT WAS TORMENTED BY THE QUESTION

CREPT UNOBSERVED INTO HIS HEART AND ONCE MORE BOUND HIM TO LIFE. AND
LIPS, HAD SHED GENTLE, HAPPY TEARS, LOVE FOR A PARTICULAR WOMAN AGAIN
FOR WHOM HE LONGED APPEAR BEFORE HIM AND, HAVING PRESSED HER HAND TO HIS
BUT AFTER THE NIGHT IN MYTISHCHI WHEN, HALF DELIRIOUS, HE HAD SEEN HER

IT? SO MUCH THE BETTER!"
REMEMBERED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DIE, HE SAID TO HIMSELF: "WELL, WHAT OF
LOVE--STANDS BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. WHEN DURING THOSE FIRST DAYS HE
HE DESTROYED THAT DREADFUL BARRIER WHICH--IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
PRINCIPLE OF LOVE, THE MORE HE RENOUNCED LIFE AND THE MORE COMPLETELY
TO LIVE THIS EARTHLY LIFE. AND THE MORE IMBUED HE BECAME WITH THAT
ALWAYS TO SACRIFICE ONESELF FOR LOVE MEANT NOT TO LOVE ANYONE, NOT
DETACHED HIMSELF FROM EARTHLY LIFE. TO LOVE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY AND
PRINCIPLE OF ETERNAL LOVE REVEALED TO HIM, THE MORE HE UNCONSCIOUSLY
SPENT AFTER HE WAS WOUNDED, THE MORE DEEPLY HE PENETRATED INTO THE NEW

 HE HAD FELT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN THE SHELL SPUN LIKE A TOP

TORMENTING FEAR OF DEATH--THE END--BUT NOW HE NO LONGER UNDERSTOOD THAT
FORMERLY HE HAD FEARED THE END. HE HAD TWICE EXPERIENCED THAT TERRIBLY


LIGHTNESS HE EXPERIENCED, ALMOST COMPREHENSIBLE AND PALPABLE...
CONTINUALLY ALL HIS LIFE--WAS NOW NEAR TO HIM AND, BY THE STRANGE

"WHY TALK OF ME?" SHE SAID QUIETLY AND GLANCED AT NATASHA.

AFTER CALLING HER SO IN HIS PRESENCE DID NATASHA NOTICE IT HERSELF.

PIERRE COULD NOT AFTERWARDS REMEMBER HOW HE WENT, WHETHER IT WAS FAR, OR

"YES, OF COURSE!" REPLIED DAVOUT, BUT WHAT THIS "YES" MEANT, PIERRE DID

HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND SAW THAT THE ADJUTANT WAS PUTTING ANOTHER

WHEN THE ADJUTANT REMINDED HIM OF THE PRISONER, HE JERKED HIS HEAD IN

BUTTONING UP HIS UNIFORM. IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN PIERRE.
DAVOUT BRIGHTENED UP AT THE NEWS THE ADJUTANT BROUGHT, AND BEGAN

DAVOUT TURNED AWAY. WITH AN UNEXPECTED REVERBERATION IN HIS VOICE PIERRE

"HE IS A RUSSIAN SPY," DAVOUT INTERRUPTED, ADDRESSING ANOTHER GENERAL

"YOU CANNOT KNOW ME, GENERAL, I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU..."

AS IN A VISE.
THE CHILL THAT HAD BEEN RUNNING DOWN PIERRE'S BACK NOW SEIZED HIS HEAD

CALCULATED TO FRIGHTEN PIERRE.
"I KNOW THAT MAN," HE SAID IN A COLD, MEASURED TONE, EVIDENTLY

SCREWED UP HIS EYES, AND LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIM.

THE DAY AFTER HER PARTY THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE CAME TO SEE MALVINTSEVA

AND HOPES THAT HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF AWAKENING WITHIN HER AND WERE

WORRIED TOO ABOUT HER NEPHEW'S EDUCATION FOR WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT

INCESSANTLY TORTURED BY THE THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS TO WHICH HER BROTHER,

NICHOLAS BRUSQUELY (IMAGINING THIS TO BE CHARACTERISTICALLY MILITARY)
EVIDENTLY PLEASED WITH HIS MILITARY DESIGNATION AND RANK. HE RECEIVED
THE COMMANDER OF THE MILITIA WAS A CIVILIAN GENERAL, AN OLD MAN WHO WAS

TIME, WENT TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO THE AUTHORITIES.
CLEAN-SHAVEN AND IN A FULL-DRESS UNIFORM HE HAD NOT WORN FOR A LONG
ORDERED THINGS HE HAD LONG BEEN DEPRIVED OF IN CAMP, AND NEXT DAY, VERY
IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS NICHOLAS ARRIVED AT NIGHT AT A HOTEL IN VORONEZH,

WITH THEM.
TOO, WHO WERE PLEASED AND FLATTERED THAT A PASSING OFFICER SHOULD JOKE
AND HEALTHY, WITHOUT A DOZEN OFFICERS MAKING UP TO EACH OF THEM; WOMEN,
A LONG WHILE SPECIALLY SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIM WERE THE WOMEN, YOUNG
THEM, HE REJOICED AS THOUGH SEEING ALL THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHAT FOR
WHERE CATTLE WERE GRAZING, POSTHOUSES WITH STATIONMASTERS ASLEEP IN
WITH PEASANTS AND PEASANT WOMEN, GENTLEMEN'S COUNTRY HOUSES, FIELDS
FROM SOLDIERS, WAGONS, AND THE FILTHY TRACES OF A CAMP--HE SAW VILLAGES
ARMY'S FORAGING OPERATIONS, PROVISION TRAINS, AND HOSPITALS. WHEN--FREE
THE DELIGHT NICHOLAS FELT WHEN HE ESCAPED FROM THE REGION COVERED BY THE
CONTINUOUSLY IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF CAMPAIGNING AND WAR--CAN UNDERSTAND
ONLY A MAN WHO HAS EXPERIENCED IT--THAT IS, HAS PASSED SOME MONTHS

ADVANCE, HE SET OUT WITH POST HORSES FOR VORONEZH.
NECESSARY MONEY AND WARRANTS, AND HAVING SENT SOME HUSSARS ON IN
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO, NICHOLAS RECEIVED THE

COMRADES FULLY UNDERSTOOD.
WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE--WHICH HE DID NOT CONCEAL AND WHICH HIS
REGRET AT BEING PREVENTED FROM TAKING PART IN THE COMING BATTLE, BUT
SENT TO VORONEZH TO BUY REMOUNTS FOR HIS DIVISION, NOT ONLY WITHOUT
AS HE LOOKED AT THE MATTER IN THIS WAY, HE LEARNED THAT HE WAS BEING

OF YEARS' TIME.
SO IT WAS QUITE LIKELY HE MIGHT BE IN COMMAND OF A REGIMENT IN A COUPLE
FIGHTING WOULD PROBABLY GO ON FOR A LONG TIME YET, AND THAT THINGS BEING
HEARD THAT THE REGIMENTS WERE TO BE MADE UP TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH, THAT
IT, THAT KUTUZOV AND OTHERS WERE THERE FOR THAT PURPOSE, BUT THAT HE HAD
RUSSIA, HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS NOT HIS BUSINESS TO THINK ABOUT
BRAINS OVER IT. HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE STATE OF
GOING ON IN RUSSIA WITHOUT DESPAIR AND WITHOUT DISMALLY RACKING HIS
WITHOUT ANY AIM AT SELF-SACRIFICE, AND HE THEREFORE LOOKED AT WHAT WAS
AND PROLONGED PART IN THE DEFENSE OF HIS COUNTRY, BUT DID SO CASUALLY,
AS THE WAR HAD CAUGHT HIM IN THE SERVICE, NICHOLAS ROSTOV TOOK A CLOSE

VIVANDIERE, AND LIKE MATTERS.
THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR NEXT PAY, THEIR NEXT QUARTERS, OF MATRESHKA THE
OF ITS BURNED RUINS NO ONE SWORE TO BE AVENGED ON THE FRENCH, BUT THEY
THERE WAS LITTLE TALK OR THOUGHT OF MOSCOW, AND WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT
SELF-SACRIFICE AND SO ON; BUT IN THE ARMY WHICH RETIRED BEYOND MOSCOW
MILITIA UNIFORMS, WEPT FOR RUSSIA AND ITS ANCIENT CAPITAL AND TALKED OF
IN THE PROVINCES AT A DISTANCE FROM MOSCOW, LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN IN
RUSSIA THE LESS DID HE REALIZE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE. IN PETERSBURG AND
THE MORE CLOSELY A MAN WAS ENGAGED IN THE EVENTS THEN TAKING PLACE IN

REALIZE IT HIS EFFORTS ARE FRUITLESS.
IN AN HISTORIC EVENT NEVER UNDERSTANDS ITS SIGNIFICANCE. IF HE TRIES TO
APPLICABLE. ONLY UNCONSCIOUS ACTION BEARS FRUIT, AND HE WHO PLAYS A PART
FORBIDDING US TO EAT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE IS SPECIALLY
ACTIONS NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY BE GUILTY OF. IN HISTORIC EVENTS THE RULE
USELESS CONDEMNATION AND ANGER DIRECTED AGAINST PEOPLE ACCUSED OF
INTO THEIR CONVERSATION EITHER A SHADE OF PRETENSE AND FALSEHOOD OR
WHO DISCUSSED RUSSIA'S POSITION AT THE TIME INVOLUNTARILY INTRODUCED
EVEN THOSE, FOND OF INTELLECTUAL TALK AND OF EXPRESSING THEIR FEELINGS,
YOUNG LADIES PREPARED AND THAT NEVER REACHED THE WOUNDED, AND SO ON.
MAMONOV'S REGIMENTS WHICH LOOTED RUSSIAN VILLAGES, AND THE LINT THE
COMMON GOOD TURNED OUT TO BE USELESS AND FOOLISH--LIKE PIERRE'S AND
OF SOCIETY, THEY SAW EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN, AND ALL THEY DID FOR THE
PART IN IT BY SELF-SACRIFICE AND HEROISM WERE THE MOST USELESS MEMBERS
THOSE WHO TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND TO TAKE

WHOSE ACTIVITIES AT THAT PERIOD WERE MOST USEFUL.
GUIDED ONLY BY THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS, AND THEY WERE THE VERY PEOPLE
THAT TIME PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF EVENTS BUT WERE
PUBLIC INTEREST FROM BEING FELT OR EVEN NOTICED. MOST OF THE PEOPLE AT
SO MUCH TRANSCEND THE GENERAL INTERESTS THAT THEY ALWAYS PREVENT THE
THAT PEOPLE HAD. YET IN REALITY THOSE PERSONAL INTERESTS OF THE MOMENT
INTEREST OF THAT TIME AND DO NOT SEE ALL THE PERSONAL HUMAN INTERESTS
SO. IT APPEARS SO TO US BECAUSE WE SEE ONLY THE GENERAL HISTORIC
DESPAIR, GRIEF, AND THE HEROISM OF THE RUSSIANS. BUT IT WAS NOT REALLY
WITHOUT EXCEPTION SPEAK ONLY OF THE SELF-SACRIFICE, PATRIOTIC DEVOTION,
OR WEEPING OVER ITS DOWNFALL. THE TALES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THAT TIME
WERE SOLELY ENGAGED IN SACRIFICING THEMSELVES, SAVING THEIR FATHERLAND,
DEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND, ALL RUSSIANS FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST
DISTANT PROVINCES, AND ONE LEVY AFTER ANOTHER WAS BEING RAISED FOR THE
WHEN HALF RUSSIA HAD BEEN CONQUERED AND THE INHABITANTS WERE FLEEING TO

INDISTINCT SHAPE IN THE CORNER, AND MISTOOK HIS KNEES RAISED UNDER THE
IMAGINATION HE WAS THAT TERRIBLE MOANING PERSONIFIED. WHEN SHE SAW AN
MOANING OF THE ADJUTANT'S? YES, HE WAS ALTOGETHER LIKE THAT. IN HER
SEE. HOW WAS HE MAIMED? WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM? WAS HE LIKE THAT INCESSANT
THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME SHE WAS FILLED WITH DREAD OF WHAT SHE MIGHT

MORE CONVINCED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY.

SOMETHING WAS LYING, STOOD A TALLOW CANDLE WITH A LONG, THICK, AND

NO ONE REPLIED. NATASHA ROSE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY, CROSSED HERSELF, AND

"SONYA, ARE YOU ASLEEP? MAMMA?" SHE WHISPERED.

AND BEGAN REPLAITING IT. HER LONG, THIN, PRACTICED FINGERS RAPIDLY

"OH, YES... I'LL LIE DOWN AT ONCE," SAID NATASHA, AND BEGAN HURRIEDLY

TOUCHING NATASHA'S SHOULDERS. "COME, LIE DOWN."
"LIE DOWN, DARLING; LIE DOWN, MY PET," SAID THE COUNTESS, SOFTLY

A LOOK WITH SONYA.
BUT THIS DREADFUL INCESSANT MOANING MADE HER SOB. THE COUNTESS EXCHANGED
THE SAME YARD AS THEMSELVES AND IN A PART OF THE HUT ACROSS THE PASSAGE;
IT WAS NOT PRINCE ANDREW WHO WAS MOANING. SHE KNEW PRINCE ANDREW WAS IN
SHAKING WITH SOBS AND THROBBING AGAINST THE WINDOW FRAME. NATASHA KNEW
HER HEAD OUT INTO THE DAMP NIGHT AIR, AND THE COUNTESS SAW HER SLIM NECK

IRRITABLY AND SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT. THROUGH THE OPEN

WHAT THEY TOLD HER, AND CONVINCED THAT SAY WHAT SHE MIGHT SHE WOULD
SHE CEASED TO ASK QUESTIONS OR TO SPEAK AT ALL, EVIDENTLY DISBELIEVING
HIM, THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED BUT THAT HIS LIFE WAS NOT IN DANGER,
COULD SHE SEE HIM? BUT AFTER SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE
QUESTIONS: WHERE WAS HE GOING? HOW WAS HE WOUNDED? WAS IT SERIOUS? AND
WOUNDED AND WAS TRAVELING WITH THEIR PARTY, SHE HAD AT FIRST ASKED MANY

NOR THE BURNING OF MOSCOW NOR ANYTHING ELSE COULD SEEM OF IMPORTANCE TO

"WHAT'S BURNING?" ASKED NATASHA. "OH, YES, MOSCOW."

"LOOK, NATASHA, HOW DREADFULLY IT IS BURNING!" SAID SHE.

COUSIN.
AS IF TRYING TO ATONE FOR HER FAULT, PAID UNCEASING ATTENTION TO HER
SHE WAS WITH SONYA. SONYA HAD CRIED AND BEGGED TO BE FORGIVEN AND NOW,
WITH THEIR PARTY. THE COUNTESS HAD SELDOM BEEN SO ANGRY WITH ANYONE AS
IT NECESSARY TO TELL NATASHA OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND OF HIS BEING
AND ANNOYANCE OF THE COUNTESS, HAD FOR SOME UNACCOUNTABLE REASON FOUND
THIS CONDITION OF STUPOR SINCE THE MORNING, WHEN SONYA, TO THE SURPRISE

THERE WAS NOTHING TERRIBLE IN THE ONE SMALL, DISTANT FIRE IN THE IMMENSE

HE HAD ABANDONED EVERYTHING AND NOT LEFT THE CITY, BUT REMAINED THERE
THE FACT THAT PIERRE WAS VERY RICH, HAD TWO MANSIONS IN MOSCOW, AND THAT
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN PIERRE'S STORY THE CAPTAIN WAS IMPRESSED BY

HIS NAME.
HE ALSO TOLD WHAT HE HAD AT FIRST CONCEALED--HIS OWN POSITION AND EVEN
ALL HIS OWN SIMPLE RELATIONS WITH HER. URGED ON BY RAMBALLE'S QUESTIONS
MARRIAGE, NATASHA'S LOVE FOR HIS BEST FRIEND, HER BETRAYAL OF HIM, AND
LOOK IN HIS SHINING EYES, HE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS LIFE: HIS
SOMETHING LOOSENED PIERRE'S TONGUE. SPEAKING THICKLY AND WITH A FARAWAY

THE CAPTAIN MADE A GESTURE SIGNIFYING THAT EVEN IF HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND

UNDERSTOOD THAT.
WHEN HE HAD REACHED THIS POINT, PIERRE ASKED THE CAPTAIN WHETHER HE

CHALLENGED BY THIS QUESTION PIERRE RAISED HIS HEAD AND FELT A NEED TO

HIMSELF FOR LOVE AND A FEELING OF ENVY OF THE LEGITIMATE HUSBAND.

IN THIS WAY, THE STUDY DOOR OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD APPEARED
WHILE PIERRE, STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF

SPEAKING TO HIMSELF AND BOWING HIS HEAD WITH A SAD BUT FIRM EXPRESSION.
WHEN KILLING NAPOLEON. "WELL THEN, TAKE ME AND EXECUTE ME!" HE WENT ON,
PUNISHES THEE,' I SHALL SAY," THOUGHT HE, IMAGINING WHAT HE WOULD SAY
BUT THAT IS ALL THE SAME! 'IT IS NOT I BUT THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE THAT

IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON. THE FRENCH HAD ALREADY ENTERED

THIS KEPT HIM IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT BORDERING ON INSANITY.
TWO ALMOST SLEEPLESS NIGHTS PASSED ON A SHORT SOFA WITHOUT BEDDING--ALL
THOSE DAYS, THE ABSENCE OF WINE AND CIGARS, HIS DIRTY UNCHANGED LINEN,

WAS SUPPORTED IN HIS DESIGN AND PREVENTED FROM RENOUNCING IT BY WHAT HE
ONLY NOW FOUND FULL SATISFACTION FOR IT. MOREOVER, AT THIS MOMENT PIERRE
AT THE SLOBODA PALACE HE HAD BEEN CONTINUOUSLY UNDER ITS INFLUENCE, BUT
FROM THE VERY DAY PIERRE HAD EXPERIENCED THIS FEELING FOR THE FIRST TIME

CRITERION OF LIFE.
POWER AND STRENGTH, AFFIRMING THE EXISTENCE OF A HIGHER, NONHUMAN
AN ORDINARY POINT OF VIEW ARE INSANE, TO TEST, AS IT WERE, HIS PERSONAL
POSSESSES: THE FEELING WHICH CAUSES A MAN TO PERFORM ACTIONS WHICH FROM
APPARENT REASON AND KNOWING THAT IT WILL COST HIM ALL THE MONEY HE
PENNY ON DRINK, AND A DRUNKEN MAN TO SMASH MIRRORS OR GLASSES FOR NO

PLACE OF THE LUXURY AND COMFORT TO WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED, TO SLEEP
OF THE BATTLE AND HAD NOW CAUSED HIM TO RUN AWAY FROM HIS HOME AND, IN
TO MOZHAYSK ON THE TWENTY-FIFTH AND TO MAKE HIS WAY TO THE VERY THICK
VIEW OF THE COMMON CALAMITY, THE SAME FEELING THAT HAD CAUSED HIM TO GO
THE FIRST WAS A FEELING OF THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICE AND SUFFERING IN
TWO EQUALLY STRONG FEELINGS DREW PIERRE IRRESISTIBLY TO THIS PURPOSE.

DESIGN EXCITED HIM STILL MORE.
AND THE RISK TO WHICH HE WOULD EXPOSE HIS LIFE BY CARRYING OUT HIS

"AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"

"YES."

"YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN, AREN'T YOU?"

"TO MOZHAYSK."

"WHERE HAVE YOU TO GO TO? TELL US!" SAID ONE OF THEM.

THE FIRE AND THE SOLDIERS LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENCE.
TO LARGE SPOONFULS AND CHEWING ONE AFTER ANOTHER, HIS FACE WAS LIT UP BY
HE HAD EVER TASTED. AS HE SAT BENDING GREEDILY OVER IT, HELPING HIMSELF
THE FOOD IN THE CAULDRON, AND HE THOUGHT IT MORE DELICIOUS THAN ANY FOOD
PIERRE SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE AND BEGAN EATING THE MASH, AS THEY CALLED

PIERRE A WOODEN SPOON AFTER LICKING IT CLEAN.
"WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE MASH?" THE FIRST SOLDIER ASKED, AND HANDED

ANOTHER SHOOK HIS HEAD.

"THERE NOW!" SAID ONE OF THE SOLDIERS.

ARE NOT HERE. I CAME TO THE BATTLE AND HAVE LOST THEM."
BETTER UNDERSTOOD BY THEM. "BY RIGHTS I AM A MILITIA OFFICER, BUT MY MEN
POSITION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO AS TO BE NEARER TO THE SOLDIERS AND
"I, I..." SAID PIERRE, FEELING IT NECESSARY TO MINIMIZE HIS SOCIAL

MAN."
WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME FOOD, ONLY LET US KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE AN HONEST
MEANING WHAT PIERRE HIMSELF HAD IN MIND, NAMELY: "IF YOU WANT TO EAT
"AND WHO MAY YOU BE?" ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY ASKED PIERRE, EVIDENTLY

EATING AND TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES, TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIM.
THE SMELL OF SMOKE. PIERRE SAT UP AND SIGHED. THE THREE SOLDIERS WERE
PUT A LITTLE DRIPPING. THE PLEASANT ODOR OF GREASY VIANDS MINGLED WITH
AND PLACED AN IRON POT ON IT INTO WHICH THEY BROKE SOME DRIED BREAD AND
THE SOLDIERS, WHO THREW SIDELONG GLANCES AT PIERRE, GOT THE FIRE TO BURN

LIGHTING A FIRE.
SOLDIERS, HAVING BROUGHT SOME FIREWOOD, SETTLED DOWN NEAR HIM AND BEGAN
HAD NO IDEA HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN THERE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THREE
TOWARD HIM WITH A TERRIFIC WHIZZ, AND THEN HE SHUDDERED AND SAT UP. HE
THE DARKNESS. HE WAS CONTINUALLY IMAGINING THAT A CANNON BALL WAS FLYING
HIS ELBOW FOR A LONG TIME, GAZING AT THE SHADOWS THAT MOVED PAST HIM IN
DUSK HAD FALLEN, AND THE ROAR OF GUNS DIED AWAY. PIERRE LAY LEANING ON

BY THE ROADSIDE.
HAVING GONE A COUPLE OF MILES ALONG THE MOZHAYSK ROAD, PIERRE SAT DOWN

AROUSED TERROR, AND BESIDES THIS THERE WERE THE FOUL AIR AND THE DUST.
OVERCOATS, THE SAME SOUNDS OF FIRING WHICH, THOUGH DISTANT NOW, STILL
STRANGELY INDIFFERENT FACES, THE SAME BLOOD, THE SAME SOLDIERS'
OF BATTLE. THERE WERE STILL THE SAME SUFFERING, EXHAUSTED, AND SOMETIMES
WAS GOING, STILL ON ALL SIDES THERE WAS WHAT THERE HAD BEEN ON THE FIELD
THOUGH SHELLS AND BULLETS DID NOT WHISTLE OVER THE ROAD ALONG WHICH HE

ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF LIFE WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HIMSELF AND ALL HE HAD SEEN AND FELT. BUT SUCH
BED. HE FELT THAT ONLY IN THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF LIFE WOULD HE
TO ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND SLEEP QUIETLY IN A ROOM IN HIS OWN
FROM THE TERRIBLE SENSATIONS AMID WHICH HE HAD LIVED THAT DAY AND RETURN
THE ONE THING HE NOW DESIRED WITH HIS WHOLE SOUL WAS TO GET AWAY QUICKLY

THE CROWDS OF SOLDIERS.
SEEING BLOOD AND HEARING CRIES AND GROANS HURRIED ON, STILL ENTANGLED IN
KNYAZKOVO WITH A CROWD OF SOLDIERS, REACHED THE DRESSING STATION, AND
FROM RAEVSKI'S BATTERY A SECOND TIME, MADE HIS WAY THROUGH A GULLY TO
TOWARD THE END OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO, PIERRE, HAVING RUN DOWN

BORODINO.
THIS LETTER WAS BROUGHT TO PIERRE'S HOUSE WHEN HE WAS ON THE FIELD OF


KEEPING--YOUR FRIEND HELENE.
AND SO I PRAY GOD TO HAVE YOU, MY FRIEND, IN HIS HOLY AND POWERFUL


THE BEARER OF THE LETTER.
FORMALITIES NECESSARY FOR A DIVORCE, WHICH WOULD BE EXPLAINED TO HIM BY
EMBRACED THE ONE TRUE FAITH, AND ASKING HIM TO CARRY OUT ALL THE

SIMPLE," SHE THOUGHT AS SHE GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE.
IS IT THAT WE IN OUR IRRECOVERABLE YOUTH DID NOT KNOW IT? YET IT IS SO
DISSIPATED BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS HIGHNESS. "SHE IS RIGHT, BUT HOW
"YES, SHE IS RIGHT," THOUGHT THE OLD PRINCESS, ALL HER CONVICTIONS

SIDLED OUT OF THE ROOM.
ENTERED TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER. THE PRINCESS NODDED TO HER DAUGHTER AND
THE OLD PRINCESS ROSE RESPECTFULLY AND CURTSIED. THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD


    * "COUNTESS, THERE IS MERCY FOR EVERY SIN."


WITH A LONG FACE AND NOSE, AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM.
"COMTESSE, A TOUT PECHE MISERICORDE," * SAID A FAIR-HAIRED YOUNG MAN


     HIM FOR NOT KEEPING HIS WORD TO ME."
     * "NO, TELL HIM I DON'T WISH TO SEE HIM, I AM FURIOUS WITH


LUI, PARCE QU'IL M'A MANQUE PAROLE." *
"NON, DITES-LUI QUE JE NE VEUX PAS LE VOIR, QUE JE SUIS FURIEUSE CONTRE

THAT HIS HIGHNESS WAS IN THE BALLROOM AND WISHED TO SEE HER.
JUST THEN THE LADY COMPANION WHO LIVED WITH HELENE CAME IN TO ANNOUNCE

THE RIGHT TO GRANT DISPENSATIONS..."
"OH, MAMMA, HOW IS IT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE HOLY FATHER, WHO HAS

"BUT, MY DEAR...."


     ANYTHING. IN MY POSITION I HAVE OBLIGATIONS."
     * "OH, MAMMA, DON'T TALK NONSENSE! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND


INTO FRENCH WHICH SUITED IT BETTER.
WHICH LANGUAGE SHE ALWAYS FELT THAT HER CASE DID NOT SOUND QUITE CLEAR,
POSITION J'AI DES DEVOIRS," * SAID HELENE CHANGING FROM RUSSIAN, IN
"AH, MAMAN, NE DITES PAS DE BETISES. VOUS NE COMPRENEZ RIEN. DANS MA

SAID THE OLD PRINCESS.
"BUT IT SAYS PLAINLY: 'WHOSOEVER SHALL MARRY HER THAT IS DIVORCED...'"

IRONICALLY.
HAVING LISTENED TO HER MOTHER'S OBJECTIONS, HELENE SMILED BLANDLY AND

DROVE TO HER DAUGHTER'S EARLY ONE MORNING SO AS TO FIND HER ALONE.
ARMED WITH THESE ARGUMENTS, WHICH APPEARED TO HER UNANSWERABLE, SHE

IS ALIVE.
WHICH (AS IT SEEMED TO HIM) PLAINLY FORBIDS REMARRIAGE WHILE THE HUSBAND
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, AND TO HER DELIGHT SHOWED HER A TEXT IN THE GOSPEL
AND REMARRIAGE DURING A HUSBAND'S LIFETIME, AND THE PRIEST TOLD HER THAT
IDEA. SHE CONSULTED A RUSSIAN PRIEST AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF DIVORCE
A SUBJECT NEAR TO HER OWN HEART, SHE COULD NOT RECONCILE HERSELF TO THE
TORMENTED BY JEALOUSY OF HER DAUGHTER, AND NOW THAT JEALOUSY CONCERNED
MARRIAGE WAS HELENE'S MOTHER, PRINCESS KURAGINA. SHE WAS CONTINUALLY
AMONG THOSE WHO VENTURED TO DOUBT THE JUSTIFIABILITY OF THE PROPOSED

HELENE LAUGHED.

"EVEN DIVORCE YOU?" SAID HE.

BILIBIN PUCKERED HIS SKIN IN PREPARATION FOR SOMETHING WITTY.

PIERRE TOO LOVED HER. "HE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR ME."
"OH, HE LOVES ME SO!" SAID HELENE, WHO FOR SOME REASON IMAGINED THAT

NAIVE A QUESTION. "WILL HE AGREE?"
HIS REPUTATION BEING SO WELL ESTABLISHED THAT HE DID NOT FEAR TO ASK SO
"BUT TELL ME, HOW WILL YOUR HUSBAND LOOK AT THE MATTER?" BILIBIN ASKED,


    * A MASTERLY WOMAN.


SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE MARRIED TO ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME," THOUGHT HE.
"UNE MAITRESSE-FEMME! * THAT'S WHAT IS CALLED PUTTING THINGS SQUARELY.

HELP IN THAT DIFFICULTY.
BILIBIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS, AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT NOT EVEN HE COULD

EITHER OF THEM. I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THEM BOTH."
BILIBIN'S SLEEVE. "BUT I LOVE THEM, YOU KNOW, AND DON'T WANT TO DISTRESS
"THAT'S A TRUE FRIEND!" SAID HELENE BEAMING, AND AGAIN TOUCHING

A MESALLIANCE BY MARRYING YOU," AND BILIBIN SMOOTHED OUT HIS FOREHEAD.
HAPPY, AND AS WIDOW OF THE GRAND... THE PRINCE WOULD NO LONGER BE MAKING
CONNECTION.) BUT IF YOU MARRY THE OLD COUNT YOU WILL MAKE HIS LAST DAYS
DISPLEASE THE COURT BESIDES. (YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME KIND OF

I HAVE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AGAIN ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR. YOU SEE, IF YOU
"YOU ARE NOT TAKING ME UNAWARES, YOU KNOW," SAID HE. "AS A TRUE FRIEND,

BILIBIN WRINKLED UP THE SKIN OVER HIS EYEBROWS AND PONDERED, WITH A

BERINGED FINGERS. "TELL ME, AS YOU WOULD A SISTER, WHAT I OUGHT TO DO.
BY THEIR SURNAMES), AND SHE TOUCHED HIS COAT SLEEVE WITH HER WHITE,
"LISTEN, BILIBIN," SAID HELENE (SHE ALWAYS CALLED FRIENDS OF THAT SORT

GAVE HER HIS VIEW OF THE MATTER AT A SMALL AND INTIMATE GATHERING.
HELENE ALWAYS HAS--MEN FRIENDS WHO CAN NEVER CHANGE INTO LOVERS--ONCE
AND WHO WAS ONE OF THE DISINTERESTED FRIENDS SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS
BILIBIN, WHO HAD NOT LOST HIS REPUTATION OF AN EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER MAN,

DAUGHTER'S AND MOVE AWAY.
CONCEALING HIS UNVARYING EMOTION HE WOULD PRESS HIS CHEEK AGAINST HIS
DEAR CHILD, CONSULT ONLY YOUR OWN HEART. THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY," AND
HEART REJOICES TO KNOW THAT YOU... YOU HAVE SUFFERED SO MUCH.... BUT, MY
CONCERNING... YOU KNOW. WELL MY DEAR CHILD, YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER'S
ASIDE, DRAWING HER HAND DOWNWARD. "I HAVE HEARD OF CERTAIN PROJECTS
"HELENE, I HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO YOU," AND HE WOULD LEAD HER

DAUGHTER WHENEVER HE CHANCED TO SEE HER:
REPEATED ONE AND THE SAME THING A HUNDRED TIMES, REMARKED TO HIS
PRINCE VASILI, WHO OF LATE VERY OFTEN FORGOT WHAT HE HAD SAID AND

THE WHOLE STING OF HER REMARK TO LIE IN THAT WORD.
AND REPEATED IN A WHISPER, THE ONE COARSE WORD SHE HAD USED, SUPPOSING
PETERSBURG AS A BUFFOON, AND SO OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID THEY ONLY NOTICED,

AN OPINION CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL ONE. MEETING HELENE AT A BALL SHE

MAGNATE WAS AT FIRST AS MUCH TAKEN ABACK BY THIS SUGGESTION OF MARRIAGE

STOPPED BY COUNT ROSTOPCHIN'S ORDERS, HAD ALREADY IN JUNE MOVED WITH HER
GREATEST GLORY OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. THE LADY WHO, AFRAID OF BEING
THAT THE MOMENTOUS EVENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED THAT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THE
OWN ACCOUNT, AND YET IT WAS ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR GOING AWAY
ABANDONED BY ITS INHABITANTS TO BE BURNED. THEY WENT AWAY EACH ON HIS
DESTRUCTION, FOR A GREAT CITY WITH WOODEN BUILDINGS WAS CERTAIN WHEN
SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT IMMENSE AND WEALTHY CITY BEING GIVEN OVER TO
TO DESTRUCTION. THEY WENT AWAY WITHOUT THINKING OF THE TREMENDOUS
THEY MUST GO AWAY, SORRY AS THEY WERE TO ABANDON THEIR PROPERTY
SERFS TO THE THREE HILLS QUARTER OF MOSCOW TO FIGHT NAPOLEON, AND THAT
IF IT COULD NOT SUCCEED IT WOULD NOT DO TO TAKE YOUNG LADIES AND HOUSE

OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BE UNDER FRENCH RULE, IT WOULD BE THE WORST THING
WHETHER THINGS WOULD GO WELL OR ILL UNDER FRENCH RULE IN MOSCOW. IT WAS
THEY WENT AWAY BECAUSE FOR RUSSIANS THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION AS TO

IT HAD TO BE DONE. WHY DID THEY GO? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPOSE THAT

IMPRESSED ON THEM THAT TO LEAVE MOSCOW WAS SHAMEFUL. THEY WERE ASHAMED

PERISHING, BUT COULD NOT STOP, ANY MORE THAN THE RUSSIAN ARMY, WEAKER
THAT HAS IN ITS ONSLAUGHT RECEIVED A MORTAL WOUND, FELT THAT THEY WERE
RUSSIANS AT BORODINO. THE FRENCH INVADERS, LIKE AN INFURIATED ANIMAL
SUPERIORITY OF HIS OPPONENT AND OF HIS OWN IMPOTENCE WAS GAINED BY THE
STANDING, BUT A MORAL VICTORY THAT CONVINCES THE ENEMY OF THE MORAL
STANDARDS, AND OF THE GROUND ON WHICH THE TROOPS HAD STOOD AND WERE
DEFINED BY THE CAPTURE OF PIECES OF MATERIAL FASTENED TO STICKS, CALLED
ATTACKING FRENCH ARMY WAS EXHAUSTED. NOT THAT SORT OF VICTORY WHICH IS
AT THE END AS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE. THE MORAL FORCE OF THE

SUCH EFFORTS THE ENEMY HAD FLED--EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR FEELING OF TERROR
AFTER ALL THEIR EXPERIENCE OF PREVIOUS BATTLES--WHEN AFTER ONE TENTH OF
SOLDIERS OF HIS ARMY WHETHER THEY HAD TAKEN PART IN THE BATTLE OR NOT,
OF THE MIGHTY ARM BEING STRICKEN POWERLESS, BUT ALL THE GENERALS AND
IT WAS NOT NAPOLEON ALONE WHO HAD EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHTMARE FEELING

FLAGGING SPIRIT OF THE TROOPS WOULD NOT PERMIT IT.
AND SOLDIERS OF THE FRENCH ARMY KNEW IT COULD NOT BE DONE, BECAUSE THE
WANT TO, BUT BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE DONE. ALL THE GENERALS, OFFICERS,
COULD NOT BE. NAPOLEON DID NOT GIVE HIS GUARDS, NOT BECAUSE HE DID NOT

TWENTY THOUSAND STRONG, MIGHT EASILY HAVE MADE THAT EFFORT. THE FRENCH
LOST ONLY A QUARTER OF THEIR MEN AND STILL HAD THEIR GUARDS INTACT,

FIFTEEN YEARS, WITH THE ASSURANCE OF NAPOLEON'S INVINCIBILITY, WITH THE
THE FRENCH, WITH THE MEMORY OF ALL THEIR FORMER VICTORIES DURING

THE RUSSIAN TROOPS HAD BEEN BROKEN UP, THERE WAS NO PART OF THE RUSSIAN
FROM THEIR POSITIONS, THEY COULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS LAST EFFORT, FOR ALL

WAY TO MOSCOW AND THEY STILL DID SO AT THE END OF THE BATTLE AS AT THE
THE FRENCH. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE THEY STOOD BLOCKING THE
THE RUSSIANS DID NOT MAKE THAT EFFORT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ATTACKING

THAT EFFORT, AND THE FLAME OF BATTLE BURNED SLOWLY OUT.

DISAPPEAR; AND ANYONE LOOKING AT THE REAR OF THE FRENCH ARMY WOULD HAVE
SAID THAT, IF ONLY THE FRENCH MADE ONE MORE SLIGHT EFFORT, IT WOULD

THEY STUMBLED AND PANTED WITH FATIGUE, PERSPIRING AND STAINED WITH BLOOD
THOUGH ONLY ONE ARTILLERYMAN SURVIVED OUT OF EVERY THREE, AND THOUGH
THEY STILL BROUGHT UP THE CHARGES, LOADED, AIMED, AND APPLIED THE MATCH,
SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE, MYSTERIOUS POWER CONTINUED TO CONTROL THEM, AND
WHAT THEY WERE DOING, THOUGH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO LEAVE OFF,
BUT THOUGH TOWARD THE END OF THE BATTLE THE MEN FELT ALL THE HORROR OF

DOING AND MIGHT HAVE THROWN UP EVERYTHING AND RUN AWAY ANYWHERE.
MOMENT THESE MEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH HORROR AT WHAT THEY WERE

PIERCING CRIES.
ANOTHER HORSE LAY, LIKE PIERRE, ON THE GROUND, UTTERING PROLONGED AND

ONLY CHARRED GREEN BOARDS AND RAGS LITTERED THE SCORCHED GRASS, AND A

WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE WAS SITTING ON THE GROUND LEANING ON HIS

DEAFENING ROAR, CRACKLING, AND WHISTLING MADE HIS EARS TINGLE.
SAME INSTANT HE WAS DAZZLED BY A GREAT FLASH OF FLAME, AND IMMEDIATELY A
SUDDENLY A TERRIBLE CONCUSSION THREW HIM BACKWARDS TO THE GROUND. AT THE
WAGONS. HE HALTED IRRESOLUTELY, NOT KNOWING WHETHER TO RETURN OR GO ON.
HE SUDDENLY ASKED HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS ALREADY NEAR THE GREEN AMMUNITION
BESIDE, AND BEHIND HIM. PIERRE RAN DOWN THE SLOPE. "WHERE AM I GOING?"
ONE CANNON BALL, ANOTHER, AND A THIRD FLEW OVER HIM, FALLING IN FRONT,

PIERRE RAN AFTER HIM, AVOIDING THE SPOT WHERE THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS

"RUN TO THE RESERVES AND BRING UP THE AMMUNITION BOXES!" HE YELLED,

STANDING, CRUMBLING DOWN THE EARTH; A BLACK BALL FLASHED BEFORE HIS EYES
A CANNON BALL STRUCK THE VERY END OF THE EARTH WORK BY WHICH HE WAS

NOW HEARD NOTHING ELSE. ON THE RIGHT OF THE BATTERY SOLDIERS SHOUTING

RAPIDLY FROM AN APPROACHING THUNDERCLOUD, SO, AS IF IN OPPOSITION TO

"ARE YOU BOWING TO A FRIEND, EH?" REMARKED ANOTHER, CHAFFING A PEASANT

SEEING THE SHELL FLY PAST AND FALL INTO THE RANKS OF THE SUPPORTS.
"NOT THIS WAY! TO THE INFANTRY!" ADDED ANOTHER WITH LOUD LAUGHTER,

"A LIVE ONE!" SHOUTED A MAN AS A WHISTLING SHELL APPROACHED.

APPROACHING ENEMY UNEXPECTEDLY. BENNIGSEN DID NOT KNOW THIS AND MOVED
AN AMBUSH, THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AND MIGHT BE ABLE TO STRIKE AN
PUT THERE TO DEFEND THE POSITION, BUT WERE IN A CONCEALED POSITION AS
PIERRE DID NOT KNOW THAT THESE TROOPS WERE NOT, AS BENNIGSEN SUPPOSED,

AND PALPABLE A BLUNDER.
HOW THE MAN WHO PUT THEM THERE BEHIND THE HILL COULD HAVE MADE SO GROSS
SHARED THEIR OPINION, BUT FOR THAT VERY REASON HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
POSITION OF THE TROOPS BEHIND THE HILL, HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THEM AND
MATTERS. LISTENING TO BENNIGSEN AND THE GENERALS CRITICIZING THE
INCREASED PIERRE'S DOUBT OF HIS OWN CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND MILITARY
THE TROOPS TO OCCUPY THE HIGH GROUND. THIS DISPOSITION ON THE LEFT FLANK
WERE PUT THERE TO BE SLAUGHTERED. BENNIGSEN ON HIS OWN AUTHORITY ORDERED
THE SAME OPINION. ONE IN PARTICULAR DECLARED WITH MARTIAL HEAT THAT THEY
UNOCCUPIED AND TO PLACE TROOPS BELOW IT. SOME OF THE GENERALS EXPRESSED
THAT IT WAS MADNESS TO LEAVE A HEIGHT WHICH COMMANDED THE COUNTRY AROUND
OCCUPIED BY TROOPS. BENNIGSEN LOUDLY CRITICIZED THIS MISTAKE, SAYING
IMPORTANCE. IN FRONT OF TUCHKOV'S TROOPS WAS SOME HIGH GROUND NOT

THEY CAME OUT ON A GLADE WHERE TROOPS OF TUCHKOV'S CORPS WERE STATIONED
IN THE THICKET. AFTER GOING THROUGH THE WOOD FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF
WHEN SEVERAL VOICES SHOUTED AT IT DID IT DART TO ONE SIDE AND DISAPPEAR

"ON THE CONTRARY IT'S VERY INTERESTING!" REPLIED PIERRE NOT QUITE

"I DON'T THINK THIS INTERESTS YOU?"

TASK. HE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT. BENNIGSEN STOPPED SPEAKING AND,
WAS MORTIFIED TO FEEL THAT HIS MENTAL CAPACITY WAS INADEQUATE FOR THE
FACULTY TO UNDERSTAND THE ESSENTIAL POINTS OF THE IMPENDING BATTLE, BUT
THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS. PIERRE LISTENED TO HIM, STRAINING EACH
BENNIGSEN SPOKE TO A GENERAL WHO APPROACHED HIM, AND BEGAN EXPLAINING

RODE AWAY FROM THE MOUND AND DISAPPEARED.
SCARCELY DISCERNIBLE FIGURES WAS NAPOLEON. AT LAST THOSE MOUNTED MEN

AN ADJUTANT TOLD PIERRE OF HIS SERENE HIGHNESS' WISH, AND PIERRE WENT

KUTUZOV NOTICED PIERRE'S FIGURE AND THE GROUP GATHERED ROUND HIM.
PERSONAL MATTERS BUT OF THE UNIVERSAL QUESTIONS OF LIFE AND DEATH.

THE EXCITEMENT SHOWN IN SOME OF THESE FACES LAY CHIEFLY IN QUESTIONS

BENNIGSEN. IN ANY CASE MANY GREAT REWARDS WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR
IF KUTUZOV WON THE BATTLE IT WOULD BE FELT THAT EVERYTHING WAS DONE BY
WHEN KUTUZOV WOULD BE DESTROYED AND THE POWER PASS TO BENNIGSEN, OR EVEN
BENNIGSEN MANAGED EVERYTHING. NOW THE DECISIVE MOMENT OF BATTLE HAD COME
SO CREATE AN IMPRESSION THAT THE OLD FELLOW WAS NOT MUCH GOOD AND THAT
LATTER AND NO ONE ELSE, WHILE SHOWING SERVILE RESPECT TO KUTUZOV, COULD

SACRIFICING EVERYTHING. HE WAS NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO
DETERMINE FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT HE FELT SUCH PARTICULAR DELIGHT IN
SOMETHING... WITH WHAT? PIERRE COULD NOT SAY, AND HE DID NOT TRY TO
LIFE ITSELF--IS RUBBISH IT IS PLEASANT TO THROW AWAY, COMPARED WITH
CONSTITUTES MEN'S HAPPINESS--THE COMFORTS OF LIFE, WEALTH, EVEN
SOMETHING. HE NOW EXPERIENCED A GLAD CONSCIOUSNESS THAT EVERYTHING THAT

JOYFUL FEELING HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE. IT WAS A FEELING AKIN TO

AFTER DINNER PIERRE LEFT MOSCOW. WHEN CHANGING HORSES THAT NIGHT
ON THE TWENTY-FOURTH THE WEATHER CLEARED UP AFTER A SPELL OF RAIN, AND

NEXT DAY TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE RELAY HORSES TO BE SENT ON IN ADVANCE.
SO ON EVSTAFEY'S REPRESENTATION PIERRE HAD TO PUT OFF HIS DEPARTURE TILL
HORSES SHOULD BE SENT THERE. THIS COULD NOT ALL BE ARRANGED THAT DAY,
HE WOULD LEAVE THAT NIGHT FOR THE ARMY AT MOZHAYSK, AND THAT HIS SADDLE
KNEW EVERYTHING, COULD DO ANYTHING, AND WAS KNOWN TO ALL MOSCOW--THAT
ON REACHING HOME PIERRE GAVE ORDERS TO EVSTAFEY--HIS HEAD COACHMAN WHO

"PLEASE COME, PRINCESS... THE PRINCE," SAID DUNYASHA IN A BREAKING

ALARM ON SEEING HER MISTRESS.
WHO WAS EVIDENTLY LOOKING FOR HER, AND WHO STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF IN
FOOTSTEPS RUNNING ALONG THE PATH. SHE ROSE AND SAW DUNYASHA HER MAID,
LONG SHE HAD BEEN THERE WHEN SHE WAS AROUSED BY THE SOUND OF A WOMAN'S

EXCEPT PASSIONATE LOVE FOR HER FATHER, LOVE SUCH AS SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD

HE DID, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY SIGNS, AND HER TONGUE TOO SEEMED TO MOVE
UNCONSCIOUSLY IMITATING HER FATHER, SHE NOW TRIED TO EXPRESS HERSELF AS

"WEREN'T YOU ASLEEP?"

HE PRESSED HER HAND.

THE PRINCE SHOOK HIS HEAD, AGAIN REPEATED THE SAME SOUNDS.
HE HAD GUESSED THEM, AND INQUIRINGLY REPEATED: "MARY, ARE YOU AFRAID?"
IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THESE SOUNDS. THE DOCTOR THOUGHT

"MMM...AR...ATE...ATE..." HE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES.

HE UTTERED.
BUT TRIED TO GUESS WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND INQUIRINGLY REPEATED THE WORDS
REPEATING THE SAME WORDS SEVERAL TIMES. SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM,

EFFORTS WITH WHICH HE MOVED HIS TONGUE MADE HER DROP HER EYES AND WITH
STRAINING ALL HER FACULTIES PRINCESS MARY LOOKED AT HIM. THE COMIC

IMPLORINGLY AT HER, EVIDENTLY AFRAID THAT SHE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND.
AND TONGUE MOVED, SOUNDS CAME, AND HE BEGAN TO SPEAK, GAZING TIMIDLY AND

PAINFUL, BUT, LOVING MY BENEFACTOR AND SOVEREIGN, I SUBMIT. ONLY I AM
TO HIM BUT OBEY HIM LIKE A CORPORAL, THOUGH I AM HIS SENIOR. THIS IS
THAN OURS, AND HE IS ALWAYS ADVISING THE MINISTER. I AM NOT MERELY CIVIL
IMPERIAL AIDE-DE-CAMP WOLZOGEN. HE IS SAID TO BE MORE NAPOLEON'S MAN
IN A MOST MASTERLY WAY. THE WHOLE ARMY FEELS GREAT SUSPICION OF THE
MILITIA. FOR THE MINISTER IS LEADING THESE VISITORS AFTER HIM TO MOSCOW

MINISTER SHOULD COMMAND THE ARMY, DOES NOT LOVE OUR SOVEREIGN AND

THE WHOLE ARMY IS IN DESPAIR THAT THIS MOST IMPORTANT PLACE HAS BEEN
ABANDONMENT OF SMOLENSK TO THE ENEMY. IT IS PITIABLE AND SAD, AND
I EXPECT THE MINISTER (BARCLAY DE TOLLY) HAS ALREADY REPORTED THE

WORD IN IT TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY.)

HEARING THAT PRINCE ANDREW HAD COME, HE WENT OUT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON
BALD HILLS AND WAS SITTING INDOORS READING THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS. ON
INTO THE HOUSE. ALPATYCH, HAVING SENT HIS FAMILY AWAY, WAS ALONE AT
ONE WINDOW WHICH WAS OPEN. A LITTLE SERF BOY, SEEING PRINCE ANDREW, RAN
THE HOUSE AMONG THE ROSEBUSHES. THE SHUTTERS WERE ALL CLOSED, EXCEPT AT
BEEN CUT DOWN AND A PIEBALD MARE AND HER FOAL WERE WANDERING IN FRONT OF

TARAS THE GARDENER, BUT NO ONE REPLIED. HAVING GONE ROUND THE CORNER
TREES IN TUBS SOME WERE OVERTURNED AND OTHERS DRIED UP. HE CALLED FOR
UP TO THE HOTHOUSE; SOME OF THE GLASS PANES WERE BROKEN, AND OF THE
HORSES AND CALVES WERE STRAYING IN THE ENGLISH PARK. PRINCE ANDREW RODE
STOOD OPEN. GRASS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO GROW ON THE GARDEN PATHS, AND
LODGE. NO ONE AT THE STONE ENTRANCE GATES OF THE DRIVE AND THE DOOR

HE HAD RECEIVED NEWS THAT HIS FATHER, SON, AND SISTER HAD LEFT FOR
THINK ABOUT ENTIRELY APART FROM GENERAL QUESTIONS. TWO DAYS PREVIOUSLY
BUT DESPITE THIS, THANKS TO HIS REGIMENT, PRINCE ANDREW HAD SOMETHING TO
PILLAGE HIS DEARLY BELOVED BALD HILLS WHICH HE HAD BUILT AND PEOPLED.
AND AFTER HIS SICK FATHER HAD HAD TO FLEE TO MOSCOW, ABANDONING TO
OF AUGUST (HE CONSIDERED THAT IT COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEFENDED)
PRINCE ANDREW, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE ABANDONMENT OF SMOLENSK ON THE SIXTH
IN TRUTH EVERYTHING PRESENTED ITSELF IN A DARK AND GLOOMY LIGHT TO

TO TRYING TO DO HIS DUTY AND NOT TO BE UNFAIR.
HIM, AND SO IN HIS RELATIONS WITH THAT FORMER CIRCLE HE CONFINED HIMSELF
CONTEMPTUOUS. EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF HIS PAST WAS REPUGNANT TO
STAFF, HE BRISTLED UP IMMEDIATELY AND GREW SPITEFUL, IRONICAL, AND
SOON AS HE CAME ACROSS A FORMER ACQUAINTANCE OR ANYONE FROM THE
TO A DIFFERENT WORLD AND WHO COULD NOT KNOW AND UNDERSTAND HIS PAST. AS
REGIMENT, TO TIMOKHIN AND THE LIKE--PEOPLE QUITE NEW TO HIM, BELONGING
OF HIM AND LOVED HIM. BUT HE WAS KIND AND GENTLE ONLY TO THOSE OF HIS
OFFICERS. IN THE REGIMENT THEY CALLED HIM "OUR PRINCE," WERE PROUD
AFFAIRS OF HIS REGIMENT AND WAS CONSIDERATE AND KIND TO HIS MEN AND
THE FOE MADE HIM FORGET HIS OWN SORROW. HE WAS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE
ABANDONMENT MADE AN EPOCH IN HIS LIFE. A NOVEL FEELING OF ANGER AGAINST
AND GIVING ORDERS, ENGROSSED HIM. THE BURNING OF SMOLENSK AND ITS

MOUTHS. WHEN THEY PASSED THROUGH A VILLAGE THEY ALL RUSHED TO THE WELLS
ATMOSPHERE. THEY MARCHED WITH HANDKERCHIEFS TIED OVER THEIR NOSES AND
SKY. THERE WAS NO WIND, AND THE MEN CHOKED IN THAT MOTIONLESS
EYE AT THE SUN, WHICH SHOWED LIKE A HUGE CRIMSON BALL IN THE UNCLOUDED
THROUGH THE SCREEN OF ITS HOT FINE PARTICLES ONE COULD LOOK WITH NAKED
ROAD. THE HIGHER THE SUN ROSE THE HIGHER ROSE THAT CLOUD OF DUST, AND
WORST OF ALL IN THE LUNGS OF THE MEN AND BEASTS AS THEY MOVED ALONG THAT
CLOUD OVER THE TROOPS, SETTLING IN EYES, EARS, HAIR, AND NOSTRILS, AND
WAS KNEADED BY THE FEET AND WHEELS, WHILE THE REST ROSE AND HUNG LIKE A
CHOKING, HOT DUST THAT NEVER COOLED EVEN AT NIGHT. SOME OF THIS DUST
HUBS OF THE WHEELS, AND THE INFANTRY SANK ANKLE-DEEP IN THAT SOFT,
WAGONS MOVED NOISELESSLY THROUGH THE DEEP DUST THAT ROSE TO THE VERY
DEEP. AS SOON AS DAY DAWNED THE MARCH BEGAN. THE ARTILLERY AND BAGGAGE
DEW WAS IMPERCEPTIBLE ON THE SANDY DUST CHURNED UP MORE THAN SIX INCHES
FRESHNESS EVEN AT NIGHT OR WHEN THE ROAD PASSED THROUGH THE FOREST; THE
ROAD, THE HIGHROAD ALONG WHICH THE TROOPS MARCHED, THERE WAS NO SUCH
IN THE FORESTS WHILE THE DEW LASTED WAS THERE ANY FRESHNESS. BUT ON THE
HUNGER, FINDING NO FOOD ON THE SUN-PARCHED MEADOWS. ONLY AT NIGHT AND
SCORCHED AND SHED ITS GRAIN. THE MARSHES DRIED UP. THE CATTLE LOWED FROM
HEAVY NIGHT DEWS ALONE REFRESHED THE EARTH. THE UNREAPED CORN WAS
EVENING THE SKY CLEARED AGAIN AND THE SUN SET IN REDDISH-BROWN MIST.
FLOATED ACROSS THE SKY AND OCCASIONALLY VEILED THE SUN, BUT TOWARD
DROUGHT HAD CONTINUED FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS. EACH DAY FLEECY CLOUDS
ALONG THE HIGHROAD PAST THE AVENUE LEADING TO BALD HILLS. HEAT AND
ON THE TENTH OF AUGUST THE REGIMENT PRINCE ANDREW COMMANDED WAS MARCHING
FROM SMOLENSK THE TROOPS CONTINUED TO RETREAT, FOLLOWED BY THE ENEMY.

MAN IN A FRIEZE COAT DRAGGING BURNING BEAMS INTO ANOTHER YARD ACROSS THE
RUSHING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS NEAR IT, AND HE SAW TWO OF THEM AND A
INTO THE SIDE STREET TO LOOK AT THE FIRE. SOLDIERS WERE CONTINUALLY
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE ON FOR SOME TIME, ALPATYCH GOT DOWN AND TURNED
THE FLAMES TALKING AND SHOUTING COULD BE HEARD. SEEING THAT HIS TRAP
FLITTED ABOUT BEFORE THE FIRE, AND THROUGH THE INCESSANT CRACKLING OF
THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE CROWDING AT THE CROSSROADS. BLACK FIGURES
SUDDENLY FLARED UP AGAIN BRIGHTLY, LIGHTING UP WITH STRANGE DISTINCTNESS
OUT. THE FLAMES NOW DIED DOWN AND WERE LOST IN THE BLACK SMOKE, NOW
HOUSE AND SOME SHOPS WERE ON FIRE. THIS FIRE WAS ALREADY BURNING ITSELF
IN A SIDE STREET NEAR THE CROSSROADS WHERE THE VEHICLES HAD STOPPED, A
MOVING AMID THE ROWS OF SOLDIERS AND OF OTHER VEHICLES, HAD TO STOP.
ALPATYCH'S CART AND THAT OF THE INNKEEPER'S WIFE, WHICH WERE SLOWLY
AMID THE SMOKE THAT SCREENED IT. ON THE SLOPING DESCENT TO THE DNIEPER
NIGHT HAD COME. THERE WERE STARS IN THE SKY AND THE NEW MOON SHONE OUT

IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DRIVE OUT.
FERAPONTOV'S WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE ALSO SITTING IN A CART WAITING TILL
IT COMPLETELY, SO THAT ALPATYCH COULD NOT PASS OUT AND HAD TO WAIT.
SOLDIERS WERE PASSING IN A CONSTANT STREAM ALONG THE STREET BLOCKING

MYSELF. WE'RE DONE FOR!..." AND FERAPONTOV RAN INTO THE YARD.
"RUSSIA IS DONE FOR!" HE CRIED. "ALPATYCH, I'LL SET THE PLACE ON FIRE

FILLING THEIR BAGS. ON SEEING ALPATYCH, FERAPONTOV TURNED TO HIM:
SOME OF THE SOLDIERS WERE FRIGHTENED AND RAN AWAY, OTHERS WENT ON

SOME BAGS OF FLOUR HIMSELF AND THROWING THEM INTO THE STREET.
"LOOT EVERYTHING, LADS! DON'T LET THOSE DEVILS GET IT!" HE CRIED, TAKING

AND LAUGHTER:
THEM, BUT SUDDENLY STOPPED AND, CLUTCHING AT HIS HAIR, BURST INTO SOBS
AND ENTERED HIS SHOP. ON SEEING THE SOLDIERS HE WAS ABOUT TO SHOUT AT
KNAPSACKS WITH FLOUR AND SUNFLOWER SEEDS. JUST THEN FERAPONTOV RETURNED
FERAPONTOV'S OPEN SHOP, TALKING LOUDLY AND FILLING THEIR BAGS AND
AS ALPATYCH WAS DRIVING OUT OF THE GATE HE SAW SOME TEN SOLDIERS IN

TRACES OF THEIR HORSES WITH TREMBLING HANDS.
INSIDE THE SHED ALPATYCH AND THE COACHMAN ARRANGED THE TANGLED REINS AND
THE SAME KIND OF LAMENTATION WAS HEARD FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STREET.
OF WHICH COULD BE SEEN IN THE FAILING TWILIGHT--AND AS IF IN REPLY
BEGAN TO WAIL AS THEY LOOKED AT THE FIRES--THE SMOKE AND EVEN THE FLAMES
AND THE COACHMAN. THE WOMEN, WHO HAD BEEN SILENT TILL THEN, SUDDENLY
SET OFF. FERAPONTOV'S WHOLE HOUSEHOLD CAME OUT TOO, FOLLOWING ALPATYCH
ALPATYCH WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE, CALLED THE COACHMAN, AND TOLD HIM TO

"I'LL TEACH YOU TO RUN INTO THE YARDS!"

GET AWAY!" AND THEN, TURNING TO THE SOLDIERS, SHOUTED:
NOTICING HIM, AN OFFICER SAID: "THE TOWN IS BEING ABANDONED. GET AWAY,

TO THE GATE. A RETREATING REGIMENT, THRONGING AND HURRYING, BLOCKED THE
RAN INTO FERAPONTOV'S YARD BEFORE ALPATYCH'S EYES. ALPATYCH WENT OUT
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS LIKE ANTS FROM A RUINED ANT-HILL. SEVERAL OF THEM
THE STREETS SOLDIERS IN VARIOUS UNIFORMS WALKED OR RAN CONFUSEDLY IN
BLACK CURLING CLOUDS OF SMOKE ROSE AND SPREAD FROM THE FIRES. THROUGH
WIDESPREAD EVERYWHERE. THE COOK'S MOANS HAD NOW SUBSIDED. ON TWO SIDES
THE MOANING, THE DISTANT CRIES, AND THE CRACKLE OF FIRES WHICH SEEMED
SEEMED TO REIGN OVER THE TOWN, BROKEN ONLY BY THE RUSTLE OF FOOTSTEPS,
SHONE STRANGELY. NOW THAT THE TERRIBLE DIN OF THE GUNS HAD CEASED A HUSH
CLOUDED WITH SMOKE, THROUGH WHICH, HIGH UP, THE SICKLE OF THE NEW MOON
AND STOPPED IN THE DOORWAY. THE EVENING SKY THAT HAD BEEN SO CLEAR WAS
TOWARD DUSK THE CANNONADE BEGAN TO SUBSIDE. ALPATYCH LEFT THE CELLAR

WONDER-WORKING ICON OF SMOLENSK.
GONE WITH OTHERS TO THE CATHEDRAL, WHENCE THEY WERE FETCHING THE

IN A PATHETIC WHISPER WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER HUSBAND WHO HAD REMAINED
ROCKED AND HUSHED HER BABY AND WHEN ANYONE CAME INTO THE CELLAR ASKED
ROSE ABOVE THE OTHER SOUNDS, DID NOT CEASE FOR A MOMENT. THE MISTRESS
WHISTLING OF PROJECTILES, AND THE PITEOUS MOANING OF THE COOK, WHICH
PORTER WERE ALL SITTING IN THE CELLAR, LISTENING. THE ROAR OF GUNS, THE
ALPATYCH, HIS COACHMAN, FERAPONTOV'S WIFE AND CHILDREN AND THE HOUSE
THIGH BROKEN BY A SHELL SPLINTER, HAD BEEN CARRIED INTO THE KITCHEN.
FIVE MINUTES LATER NO ONE REMAINED IN THE STREET. THE COOK, WITH HER

SOULS!..."
"OH-H-H! DEAR SOULS, DEAR KIND SOULS! DON'T LET ME DIE! MY GOOD

WAILING.
WITH PALE FACES ROUND THE COOK. THE LOUDEST SOUND IN THAT CROWD WAS HER
SIDES, THE FRIGHTENED BABY BEGAN TO CRY, AND PEOPLE CROWDED SILENTLY
AT THAT MOMENT THE PITIFUL WAILING OF WOMEN WAS HEARD FROM DIFFERENT

COOK.
"SCOUNDREL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" SHOUTED THE INNKEEPER, RUSHING TO THE

STREET, SOMETHING EXPLODED, AND THE STREET WAS SHROUDED IN SMOKE.
DOWNWARDS LIKE A LITTLE BIRD; A FLAME FLASHED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ONCE MORE SOMETHING WHISTLED, BUT THIS TIME QUITE CLOSE, SWOOPING

BACK, PULLING DOWN HER TUCKED-UP SKIRT.
"WHAT MARVELS!" SHE EXCLAIMED, BUT HEARING HER MASTER'S VOICE SHE TURNED

CORNER TO LISTEN TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID.
WITH SLEEVES ROLLED UP, SWINGING HER BARE ELBOWS, HAD STEPPED TO THE
"WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?" HE SHOUTED TO THE COOK, WHO IN HER RED SKIRT,

HIS TRAP. THE INNKEEPER STOOD AT THE GATE.
BUT NOT ONE FELL CLOSE BY, THEY ALL FLEW OVER. ALPATYCH WAS GETTING INTO
INTERMITTENT WHISTLE OF A SHELL, FLEW OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS INCESSANTLY,
THE SWIFT SINISTER WHISTLE OF A CANNON BALL, NOW WITH THE AGREEABLE

OTHERS JOINED THOSE MEN AND STOPPED AND TOLD HOW CANNON BALLS HAD FALLEN

"THAT'S GRAND, IT BUCKS ONE UP!" LAUGHED THE FIRST. "LUCKY YOU JUMPED

SPLINTERS!"
"WHAT FORCE!" REMARKED ONE. "KNOCKED THE ROOF AND CEILING ALL TO

THEIR HEADS. SEVERAL PEOPLE CAME ROUND THE CORNER TALKING EAGERLY.
EVERYONE TRIED TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE PROJECTILES AS THEY FLEW OVER
THE COOK AND A SHOP ASSISTANT CAME TO THE GATE. WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY

LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS AND LOOKING IN SILENCE AT THE PEOPLE.
THE SHED, BECAME QUIET AND WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS WENT TO THE GATE,

THIS BOMBARDMENT.
UP AFTER FOUR O'CLOCK. THE PEOPLE DID NOT AT ONCE REALIZE THE MEANING OF
BEING BOMBARDED BY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY GUNS WHICH NAPOLEON HAD ORDERED
TOWN AND ATTRACTED LITTLE ATTENTION FROM THE INHABITANTS. THE TOWN WAS

AND THUD WAS HEARD, FOLLOWED BY A BOOM OF CANNON BLENDING INTO A DULL
AND WENT TO THE DOOR. SUDDENLY THE STRANGE SOUND OF A FAR-OFF WHISTLING

IT WAS BY NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. HALF THE STREET WAS IN SHADOW, THE

BELLS WAS HEARD FROM THE GATEWAY AS A LITTLE TRAP PASSED OUT.

ALPATYCH REPLIED THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD NOT TOLD HIM ANYTHING DEFINITE.

FERAPONTOV. "WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED?"
"WE'LL RECKON UP! WELL, HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE GOVERNOR'S?" ASKED

AND ASKED HOW MUCH HE OWED.

BEGAN RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER IN THE PASSAGE LIKE A FRIGHTENED HEN,
SOBS OF A WOMAN, AND THE HOARSE ANGRY SHOUTING OF FERAPONTOV. THE COOK
FROM THE HOST'S ROOM CAME THE SOUNDS OF A CHILD CRYING, THE DESPAIRING
ASLEEP. HE WOKE HIM UP, TOLD HIM TO HARNESS, AND WENT INTO THE PASSAGE.
STRAIGHT TO THE SHED WHERE HIS HORSES AND TRAP WERE. THE COACHMAN WAS
ALPATYCH ENTERED THE INNYARD AT A QUICKER PACE THAN USUAL AND WENT

BARKING IN FRONT OF THE HARNESSED HORSES.

LOADED CARTS STOOD AT THE HOUSE NEXT TO FERAPONTOV'S AND WOMEN WERE
EMERGING FROM THE GATES OF THE YARDS AND MOVING ALONG THE STREETS.
CARTS PILED HIGH WITH HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS, CHAIRS, AND CUPBOARDS KEPT

WHICH HAD DRAWN NEARER AND WAS INCREASING IN STRENGTH, ALPATYCH HURRIED

A FEW MINUTES LATER THE GOVERNOR RECEIVED ALPATYCH AND HURRIEDLY SAID TO

ANNOUNCED WITH SUCH SOLEMNITY AND SIGNIFICANCE THAT THE OFFICIAL TURNED
"TO HIS HONOR BARON ASCH, FROM GENERAL-IN-CHIEF PRINCE BOLKONSKI," HE

AND HANDED HIM TWO LETTERS.
OUT ADDRESSED HIM, ONE HAND PLACED IN THE BREAST OF HIS BUTTONED COAT,
ADDRESSED TO HIM. ALPATYCH MOVED FORWARD AND NEXT TIME THE OFFICIAL CAME
AGAIN, EVIDENTLY WISHING TO AVOID THE INQUIRING LOOKS AND QUESTIONS
OFFICIAL WITH A CROSS HANGING ON HIS NECK TO FOLLOW HIM, AND VANISHED
AN OFFICIAL RAN OUT, SAID SOME WORDS TO A MERCHANT, CALLED A STOUT
DOOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S ROOM OPENED AND THEY ALL ROSE AND MOVED FORWARD.
TRADESMEN, WOMEN, AND OFFICIALS, LOOKING SILENTLY AT ONE ANOTHER. THE
ALPATYCH SWAYED HIS HEAD AND WENT UPSTAIRS. IN THE WAITING ROOM WERE

DESCENDED THE PORCH STEPS.
"THEY'VE BROUGHT US ALL TO RUIN... THE BRIGANDS!" HE REPEATED, AND

THE SOUNDS OF FIRING.
IS AGAIN, DO YOU HEAR?" SAID HE, POINTING IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE CAME
THINGS TO SUCH A PASS THAT THERE ARE NO CARTS OR ANYTHING!... THERE IT
"YES, GO AND FIND OUT!" SHOUTED THE ANGRY GENTLEMAN. "THEY'VE BROUGHT

ME TO INQUIRE INTO THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS," HE ADDED.

PORCH HE MET TWO OF THE LANDED GENTRY, ONE OF WHOM HE KNEW. THIS MAN, AN
PEOPLE, COSSACKS, AND A TRAVELING CARRIAGE OF THE GOVERNOR'S. AT THE
IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE ALPATYCH FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF

EVERYBODY WAS ASKING WHAT SHOULD BE DONE, AND ALL WERE TRYING TO CALM
ABOUT THE ARMY AND ABOUT THE ENEMY WHO WAS ALREADY ATTACKING THE TOWN,
IN THE OFFICES AND SHOPS AND AT THE POST OFFICE EVERYONE WAS TALKING
SHOPS, TO GOVERNMENT OFFICES, TO THE POST OFFICE, AND TO THE GOVERNOR'S.
SERVICE WAS BEING HELD IN THE CHURCHES AS USUAL. ALPATYCH WENT TO THE
BUT CABS WERE STILL DRIVING ABOUT, TRADESMEN STOOD AT THEIR SHOPS, AND
PEOPLE WERE HURRYING THROUGH THE STREETS AND THERE WERE MANY SOLDIERS,
O'CLOCK THE BOOMING OF CANNON WAS ADDED TO THE SOUND OF MUSKETRY. MANY
FROM BEYOND THE TOWN FIRING HAD BEEN HEARD SINCE EARLY MORNING. AT EIGHT

HARVESTING," THOUGHT ALPATYCH.
SUNNY MORNING AND BY EIGHT O'CLOCK IT WAS ALREADY HOT. "A GOOD DAY FOR

"THAT'S WHAT I SAY. FOLKS ARE FOOLISH! ALWAYS AFRAID OF THE FRENCH."

"YOU'RE WELCOME, YAKOV ALPATYCH. FOLKS ARE LEAVING THE TOWN, BUT YOU

BEFORE HIS SHOP WHICH OPENED ONTO THE STREET. ON SEEING ALPATYCH HE WENT
WEARING A WAISTCOAT OVER HIS COTTON SHIRT, FERAPONTOV WAS STANDING

NOSE, SIMILAR KNOBS OVER HIS BLACK FROWNING BROWS, AND A ROUND BELLY.
RED-FACED PEASANT IN THE FORTIES, WITH THICK LIPS, A BROAD KNOB OF A
INN, AND A CORN DEALER'S SHOP IN THAT PROVINCE. HE WAS A STOUT, DARK,
WOOD FROM THE PRINCE, HAD BEGUN TO TRADE, AND NOW HAD A HOUSE, AN
SOME THIRTY YEARS AGO FERAPONTOV, BY ALPATYCH'S ADVICE, HAD BOUGHT A
WHERE HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF PUTTING UP FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS.
IN THE GACHINA SUBURB ACROSS THE DNIEPER, AT THE INN KEPT BY FERAPONTOV,
ON REACHING SMOLENSK ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTH OF AUGUST HE PUT UP

NOT INTEREST AND DID NOT EVEN EXIST FOR ALPATYCH.
EVERYTHING NOT CONNECTED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE PRINCE'S ORDERS DID
BOUNDED BY THE WILL OF THE PRINCE, AND HE NEVER WENT BEYOND THAT LIMIT.
ALL THE INTERESTS OF HIS LIFE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS HAD BEEN

FORGOT IT.
IMPRESSED ALPATYCH, BUT IN THINKING ABOUT HIS OWN BUSINESS HE SOON
WAS BEING MOWN DOWN BY THE SOLDIERS, EVIDENTLY FOR FODDER. THIS FACT
SPLENDID FIELD OF OATS IN WHICH A CAMP HAD BEEN PITCHED AND WHICH
BUT THESE DID NOT IMPRESS HIM. WHAT STRUCK HIM MOST WAS THE SIGHT OF A
ROAD. AS HE APPROACHED SMOLENSK HE HEARD THE SOUNDS OF DISTANT FIRING,
ALPATYCH KEPT MEETING AND OVERTAKING BAGGAGE TRAINS AND TROOPS ON THE

EVENING ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST.
HAVING BAITED THE HORSES TWICE ON THE WAY, HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN TOWARD

PRINCE'S ORDERS.
HARVEST, AND ASKED HIMSELF WHETHER HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN ANY OF THE
ALREADY BEING REAPED, MADE HIS CALCULATIONS AS TO THE SOWING AND THE
OF CORN, SCRUTINIZED THE STRIPS OF RYEFIELD WHICH HERE AND THERE WERE
AS HE WENT ALONG HE LOOKED WITH PLEASURE AT THE YEAR'S SPLENDID CROP

TRYING TO IMITATE THE PRINCE NOW, LIFTED THE HAT FROM HIS BALD HEAD AND
AFTER GIVING THE CLERK ORDERS ABOUT THE WORK TO BE DONE, ALPATYCH, NOT

SPEAKING RAPIDLY JUST AS THE PRINCE DID, AND HE CLIMBED INTO THE TRAP.
"THERE! THERE! WOMEN'S FUSS! WOMEN, WOMEN!" SAID ALPATYCH, PUFFING AND

OF THE COACHMEN HELPED HIM INTO THE VEHICLE.

BUT THE CORNER BEHIND THE PIANO IN THE SITTING ROOM WAS BETTER THAN
THOUGHTS HE HAD HAD WHEN LYING THERE. IT WAS UNSATISFACTORY EVERYWHERE,
THAT COUCH WAS DREADFUL TO HIM, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSIVE
UNSATISFACTORY, BUT WORST OF ALL WAS HIS CUSTOMARY COUCH IN THE STUDY.
HE WENT ABOUT LOOKING AT EVERY CORNER. EVERY PLACE SEEMED

ROOMS WITH HIM TO SHOW HIM WHERE TO SET UP THE BED FOR THAT NIGHT.
THOUGHTS CAME TO HIM IN BED. SO HE CALLED TIKHON AND WENT THROUGH THE

IT WAS ALREADY LATE WHEN HE ROSE AFTER SEALING THE LETTER. HE WISHED

TO WRITE TO THE GOVERNOR.
FINGERED HIS PAPERS, CLOSED THE BUREAU AGAIN, AND SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE

"YES... YES... WELL, MICHAEL IVANOVICH," HE SUDDENLY WENT ON, RAISING

NO ONE SPOKE FOR A LONG TIME.

"DOESN'T HE? BUT I DIDN'T INVENT IT MYSELF."

"THE PRINCE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THAT," HE REMARKED GENTLY.

DESSALLES DROPPED HIS EYES.

HIS FACE SUDDENLY TOOK ON A MOROSE EXPRESSION. HE PAUSED. "YES, HE

"BUT, PRINCE," DESSALLES BEGAN TIMIDLY, "THE LETTER MENTIONS

CAMPAIGN OF 1807 WHICH SEEMED TO HIM SO RECENT. "BENNIGSEN SHOULD HAVE

FORGETTING THE GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF THE NIEMEN, THOUGHT THAT WHAT
NIEMEN WHEN THE ENEMY WAS ALREADY AT THE DNIEPER, BUT PRINCESS MARY,
DESSALLES LOOKED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE PRINCE, WHO WAS TALKING OF THE

"VERY POSSIBLY THE THEATER OF WAR WILL MOVE SO NEAR TO US THAT..."

"I? I?..." SAID THE PRINCE AS IF UNPLEASANTLY AWAKENED, AND NOT TAKING

"WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT, PRINCE?" DESSALLES VENTURED TO ASK.

PRINCESS MARY LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HER FATHER. HE WAS EXAMINING THE
EYES UPON IT, TOLD HER TO READ THE LETTER ALOUD. WHEN SHE HAD DONE SO

WHILE HE WAS AWAY PRINCESS MARY, DESSALLES, MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE, AND

"THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING... ALWAYS MAKE SOME MUDDLE," HE MUTTERED.

AND WENT HIMSELF.
THE ROOM THE OLD PRINCE, LOOKING UNEASILY ROUND, THREW DOWN HIS NAPKIN
MICHAEL IVANOVICH ROSE AND WENT TO THE STUDY. BUT AS SOON AS HE HAD LEFT

"NO, DON'T!" HE EXCLAIMED WITH A FROWN. "YOU GO, MICHAEL IVANOVICH."

MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE JUMPED UP EAGERLY.

"YOU KNOW--UNDER THE PAPERWEIGHT ON THE LITTLE TABLE."
"GO AND GET IT FOR ME," SAID THE OLD PRINCE TO MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE.

"OH, VERY INTERESTING!" SAID MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE.

"THAT MUST BE VERY INTERESTING," SAID DESSALLES. "PRINCE ANDREW IS IN A

ARRIVED.

MARY--"HAVEN'T YOU READ IT?"
"THERE WAS A LETTER FROM PRINCE ANDREW TODAY," HE SAID TO PRINCESS

FRENCHWOMAN AT A DISTANCE. PRINCE ANDREW'S SECOND LETTER, WRITTEN NEAR

THEIR UNIFORMS AND SETTLED DOWN AGAIN IN THEIR HOMES AND CLUBS, AND NOT
NEXT DAY THE EMPEROR LEFT MOSCOW. THE ASSEMBLED NOBLES ALL TOOK OFF

AT ONCE CONSENTED TO PETYA'S REQUEST AND WENT HIMSELF TO ENTER HIS NAME.

SOBBED OUTRIGHT LIKE A CHILD AND KEPT REPEATING:
WEEPING. TEARS FILLED THE THIN MAN'S EYES, AND THE FAT OTKUPSHCHIK
THE MAYOR, A MAN WITH A THIN SALLOW FACE AND NARROW BEARD. BOTH WERE
MERCHANTS, ONE OF WHOM PIERRE KNEW, A FAT OTKUPSHCHIK. THE OTHER WAS

BEFORE TEARS GUSHED FROM HIS EYES AND HE CONCLUDED IN A TREMBLING
AS BECAME KNOWN LATER, HE HAD SCARCELY BEGUN TO ADDRESS THE MERCHANTS
COME OUT FROM THE MERCHANTS' HALL WITH TEARS OF EMOTION IN HIS EYES.
THERE HE REMAINED ABOUT TEN MINUTES. PIERRE WAS AMONG THOSE WHO SAW HIM
FROM THE HALL OF THE NOBILITY THE EMPEROR WENT TO THAT OF THE MERCHANTS.

EVERYTHING IN HIS OWN WAY.
STOOD AT THE BACK, AND, THOUGH HE HAD HEARD HARDLY ANYTHING, UNDERSTOOD
"YES, MOST PRECIOUS... A ROYAL WORD," SAID COUNT ROSTOV, WITH A SOB. HE

RAPTUROUS EXCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD FROM ALL SIDES.
THE EMPEROR CEASED SPEAKING, THE CROWD BEGAN PRESSING ROUND HIM, AND

SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS. I THANK YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHERLAND!
"I NEVER DOUBTED THE DEVOTION OF THE RUSSIAN NOBLES, BUT TODAY IT HAS

WHAT HE DID HEAR HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE EMPEROR SPOKE OF THE DANGER

NOBLES. EVERY FACE EXPRESSED RESPECTFUL, AWE-STRUCK CURIOSITY. PIERRE
THE EMPEROR ENTERED THE HALL THROUGH A BROAD PATH BETWEEN TWO LINES OF

THE WHOLE THRONG HURRIED TO THE ENTRANCE.
"THE EMPEROR! THE EMPEROR!" A SUDDEN CRY RESOUNDED THROUGH THE HALLS AND

STRETCH THEIR LEGS AND CONVERSE IN COUPLES.
WITH APPARENT RELIEF, AND BEGAN WALKING UP AND DOWN, ARM IN ARM, TO
CHAIRS MADE A SCRAPING NOISE AS THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD CONFERRED ROSE
OUT OF EVERY THOUSAND SERFS, AS THE SMOLENSK GENTRY HAD DONE. THEIR

TO THE MERCHANTS' HALL--"BUT OUR BUSINESS IS TO SUPPLY MEN AND NOT SPARE
US AND THE MERCHANTS. MILLIONS WILL POUR FORTH FROM THERE"--HE POINTED
THERE IS LITTLE NEED FOR DISCUSSION. THE EMPEROR HAS DEIGNED TO SUMMON
"I AM STRAIGHT FROM THE PALACE. SEEING THE POSITION WE ARE IN, I THINK

RE-FORMED, AND THEN MOVED WITH A HUM OF TALK INTO THE LARGEST HALL AND
TO SIGNIFY HIS APPROVAL OF THEM ALL, AND THE GROUP INCREASED, DISPERSED,
SHOUTED AND TALKED AT THE SAME TIME, SO THAT COUNT ROSTOV HAD NOT TIME

SONOROUS, MUSICAL, AND ARISTOCRATIC BARITONE VOICE, PLEASANTLY
QUITE DIFFERENT FROM HIS OWN. THE NAVAL OFFICER SPOKE IN A PARTICULARLY
AND CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THE MAN WAS INDEED A LIBERAL, BUT OF VIEWS
WITH HIM. PIERRE PUSHED HIS WAY INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP, LISTENED,
QUIETEST OF MEN WALKED AWAY DISAPPROVINGLY OR EXPRESSED DISAGREEMENT
AND FROM THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE PIERRE KNEW AS THE MEEKEST AND
BOLDLY, AS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE EXPRESSION ON THE FACES OF THE LISTENERS
TO WHAT THE SPEAKER WAS SAYING. THE RETIRED NAVAL MAN WAS SPEAKING VERY
LISTENED WITH A KINDLY SMILE AND NODS OF APPROVAL, AS HE ALWAYS DID,
WITH ALL OF WHOM HE WAS ACQUAINTED. HE TOO APPROACHED THAT GROUP AND
CATHERINE'S TIME, WAS SAUNTERING WITH A PLEASANT SMILE AMONG THE CROWD,
THE SPEAKER AND LISTENED. COUNT ILYA ROSTOV, IN A MILITARY UNIFORM OF
PRESSING ROUND HIM. PIERRE WENT UP TO THE CIRCLE THAT HAD FORMED ROUND
NAVAL OFFICER, WAS SPEAKING IN ONE OF THE ROOMS, AND A SMALL CROWD WAS
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, HANDSOME AND VIRILE, IN THE UNIFORM OF A RETIRED

INDEFINITE. THEN ALL PREFERRED LISTENING TO SPEAKING.

PROVINCES... AND SO ON; BUT AS SOON AS THE WAR WAS TOUCHED ON, OR
HONOR, WHETHER THEY SHOULD GROUP THEMSELVES BY DISTRICTS OR BY WHOLE
THE EMPEROR ENTERED, WHEN A BALL SHOULD BE GIVEN IN THE EMPEROR'S
HEARD QUESTIONS OF WHERE THE MARSHALS OF THE NOBILITY WERE TO STAND WHEN
ABOUT DISCUSSING IT. BESIDES THE ORDINARY TOPICS OF CONVERSATION, PIERRE
THE EMPEROR'S MANIFESTO WAS READ, EVOKING ENTHUSIASM, AND THEN ALL MOVED

FINDING ANY CONFIRMATION OF THE IDEAS THAT OCCUPIED HIM.
STROLLED ABOUT WATCHING AND LISTENING TO CONVERSATIONS, BUT NOWHERE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT WHICH HE HAD LONG AWAITED WAS DRAWING NEAR, HE
PEOPLE--STRENGTHENED THIS IDEA. AND IMAGINING THAT IN THIS DIRECTION
THE SOVEREIGN WAS COMING TO THE CAPITAL FOR CONSULTATION WITH HIS
REVOLUTION. THE WORDS THAT HAD STRUCK HIM IN THE EMPEROR'S APPEAL--THAT
GRAVEN IN HIS SOUL: THOUGHTS OF THE CONTRAT SOCIAL AND THE FRENCH
A WHOLE SERIES OF IDEAS HE HAD LONG LAID ASIDE BUT WHICH WERE DEEPLY
MERCHANT-CLASS--LES ETATS GENERAUX (STATES-GENERAL)--EVOKED IN HIM
THIS EXTRAORDINARY GATHERING NOT ONLY OF NOBLES BUT ALSO OF THE
UNIFORM THAT HAD BECOME TOO TIGHT FOR HIM. HE WAS AGITATED;
PIERRE WAS THERE TOO, BUTTONED UP SINCE EARLY MORNING IN A NOBLEMAN'S

ZINAIDA DMITRIEVNA'S HEALTH, AND SO ON.
SAME TIME THE EVERYDAY INTERESTS IN A BOSTON CARD PARTY, PETER THE COOK,
CONTRADICTION: THE GENERAL EXPECTATION OF A SOLEMN EVENT, AND AT THE
OF THE CROWD PETYA HAD SEEN IN THE SQUARE, THERE WAS A STRIKING
THEMSELVES TO SOMEONE YOUNGER. ON ALL THESE FACES, AS ON THE FACES
PLACES AND WERE SILENT, OR, IF THEY WALKED ABOUT AND TALKED, ATTACHED
WERE ESPECIALLY STRIKING. FOR THE MOST PART THEY SAT QUIETLY IN THEIR
DIM-EYED, TOOTHLESS, BALD, SALLOW, AND BLOATED, OR GAUNT AND WRINKLED,
DIVERSE AND FAMILIAR PERSONALITIES, BOTH OLD AND YOUNG. THE OLD MEN,
OF BEING IN UNIFORM IMPARTED SOMETHING STRANGE AND FANTASTIC TO THESE
THE ORDINARY UNIFORM OF THE NOBILITY, AND THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTIC
OF EMPEROR PAUL, OTHERS AGAIN IN THE NEW UNIFORMS OF ALEXANDER'S TIME OR
HOUSES, WERE IN UNIFORM--SOME IN THAT OF CATHERINE'S DAY, OTHERS IN THAT
ALL THESE NOBLES, WHOM PIERRE MET EVERY DAY AT THE CLUB OR IN THEIR OWN

BUT MOST OF THE GENTRY WERE STROLLING ABOUT THE ROOM.
HIGH-BACKED CHAIRS AT A LARGE TABLE UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF THE EMPEROR,
AN INCESSANT MOVEMENT AND BUZZ OF VOICES. THE CHIEF MAGNATES SAT ON
OF BLUE CLOTH AND WEARING MEDALS. IN THE NOBLEMEN'S HALL THERE WAS
THEIR UNIFORMS, IN THE SECOND BEARDED MERCHANTS IN FULL-SKIRTED COATS
THE GREAT HALLS WERE FULL. IN THE FIRST WERE THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY IN

WERE STANDING OUTSIDE THE SLOBODA PALACE.
TWO DAYS LATER, ON THE FIFTEENTH OF JULY, AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF CARRIAGES

THERE WOULD BE LEAST DANGER.
YIELDED--WENT TO INQUIRE HOW HE COULD ARRANGE FOR PETYA TO SERVE WHERE
RUN AWAY. AND NEXT DAY, COUNT ILYA ROSTOV--THOUGH HE HAD NOT YET QUITE
AND FIRMLY THAT IF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER THE SERVICE HE WOULD
ALSO ENTERING THE REGIMENT. ON RETURNING HOME PETYA ANNOUNCED RESOLUTELY
THE KREMLIN, BUT CALLED ON HIS FRIEND OBOLENSKI, WHO WAS FIFTEEN AND WAS
THE ENJOYMENT OF THAT DAY WAS OVER. HE DID NOT GO STRAIGHT HOME FROM
HAPPY AS PETYA WAS, HE FELT SAD AT HAVING TO GO HOME KNOWING THAT ALL

SAID BY VARIOUS PEOPLE.
"THERE! I SAID IF ONLY WE WAITED--AND SO IT WAS!" WAS BEING JOYFULLY

TO DISPERSE.
THE EMPEROR WENT IN, AND AFTER THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE CROWD BEGAN

"HURRAH!" WITH A VOICE ALREADY HOARSE.
SEIZED A BISCUIT, AND AS IF FEARING TO BE TOO LATE, AGAIN SHOUTED
HER HAND DID NOT REACH THEM. PETYA PUSHED HER HAND AWAY WITH HIS KNEE,
THOUGH SHE WAS LYING ON THE GROUND--SHE GRABBED AT SOME BISCUITS BUT
CATCHING AT A BISCUIT; THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT CONSIDER HERSELF DEFEATED
MUST NOT GIVE WAY. HE SPRANG FORWARD AND UPSET AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS
BUT HE HAD TO HAVE A BISCUIT FROM THE TSAR'S HAND AND HE FELT THAT HE
DANGER OF BEING CRUSHED, HE RUSHED AT THE BISCUITS. HE DID NOT KNOW WHY,
THE BALCONY. PETYA'S EYES GREW BLOODSHOT, AND STILL MORE EXCITED BY THE
A PLATEFUL OF BISCUITS BROUGHT HIM AND BEGAN THROWING THEM DOWN FROM
PEOPLE IN THE CROWD RUSHED AT THE COACHMAN. SEEING THIS THE EMPEROR HAD
A JERKIN, WHO STOOD NEAREST, SPRANG FORWARD AND SNATCHED IT UP. SEVERAL
OFF, FELL ON THE BALCONY PARAPET, AND THEN TO THE GROUND. A COACHMAN IN
A LARGISH PIECE OF THE BISCUIT THE EMPEROR WAS HOLDING IN HIS HAND BROKE

WITH JOY.
IT, AND AGAIN THE WOMEN AND MEN OF WEAKER MOLD, PETYA AMONG THEM, WEPT
"ANGEL! DEAR ONE! HURRAH! FATHER!..." CRIED THE CROWD, AND PETYA WITH

TOWARD THE BALCONY.
AND WENT OUT ONTO THE BALCONY. THE PEOPLE, WITH PETYA AMONG THEM, RUSHED
THE DINNER WAS NEARLY OVER, AND THE EMPEROR, MUNCHING A BISCUIT, ROSE

"THE PEOPLE ARE STILL HOPING TO SEE YOUR MAJESTY AGAIN."

WHILE THE EMPEROR WAS DINING, VALUEV, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW, SAID:

GLIMPSES OF WHOM COULD BE SEEN THROUGH THE WINDOWS.
TO DINE WITH THE EMPEROR AND THE COURT FOOTMEN WHO SERVED AT TABLE,
NOT WHAT, AND ENVYING ALIKE THE NOTABLES HE SAW ARRIVING AT THE ENTRANCE
THE EMPEROR DINED--LOOKING IN AT THE PALACE WINDOWS, EXPECTING HE KNEW
THAT DIMINISHING, BUT STILL CONSIDERABLE, CROWD BEFORE THE PALACE WHILE
WAS DRENCHED WITH PERSPIRATION, YET HE DID NOT GO HOME BUT STOOD WITH
TO DISPERSE. IT WAS ALREADY LATE, AND PETYA HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING AND
THE CROWD RAN AFTER THE EMPEROR, FOLLOWED HIM TO THE PALACE, AND BEGAN

ARMY.
"HURRAH!" AND RESOLVED THAT TOMORROW, COME WHAT MIGHT, HE WOULD JOIN THE
ON HIM--THOUGH IT HAPPENED NOT TO BE THE EMPEROR--FRANTICALLY SHOUTED
TEARS OF JOY THAT FILLED HIS EYES, CONCENTRATED ALL HIS ENTHUSIASM
FIXING ON ONE OF THOSE FOUR MEN, WHOM HE COULD NOT CLEARLY SEE FOR THE
HIM, BUT NO ONE ANSWERED HIM, EVERYBODY WAS TOO EXCITED; AND PETYA,
"WHICH IS HE? WHICH?" ASKED PETYA IN A TEARFUL VOICE, OF THOSE AROUND

CATHEDRAL DOORS. "HURRAH! HURRAH!" SHOUTED THE CROWD AGAIN.
AGAIN. AT LAST FOUR MEN IN UNIFORMS AND SASHES EMERGED FROM THE
AGAIN RAISED, AND THOSE WHO HAD RUN TO LOOK AT THE CANNON RAN BACK
CATHEDRAL, AND AFTER THEM OTHERS IN A MORE LEISURELY MANNER: CAPS WERE
OFFICERS, GENERALS, AND GENTLEMEN-IN-WAITING CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE
HIS PROTECTION STOPPED HIM. THE FIRING WAS STILL PROCEEDING WHEN
HAVE RUN THERE, BUT THE CLERK WHO HAD TAKEN THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN UNDER
IMPETUOUSLY TOWARD THE EMBANKMENT TO WATCH THE FIRING. PETYA TOO WOULD
TO CELEBRATE THE SIGNING OF PEACE WITH THE TURKS, AND THE CROWD RUSHED
SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF A FIRING OF CANNON WAS HEARD FROM THE EMBANKMENT,

INTENSIFIED HIS SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OCCASION.
WHEN HE WAS BEING CRUSHED, TOGETHER WITH THAT OF RAPTURE, STILL FURTHER
BY HIS LOVE FOR HIM. THE FEELING OF PAIN AND FEAR HE HAD EXPERIENCED
THE CANNON--STILL AGITATED AS BEFORE BY THE THOUGHT OF THE EMPEROR AND
THEY DID NOT INTEREST HIM NOW. HE SAT ON HIS ELEVATION--THE PEDESTAL OF

NUTS. ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE JOKING WITH THE GIRLS,
TWO YOUNG CITIZENS WERE JOKING WITH SOME SERF GIRLS WHO WERE CRACKING
THE WORD "PLENARY" (OF THE SERVICE), A WORD PETYA DID NOT UNDERSTAND.
WERE OFFICIATING THAT DAY WITH THE BISHOP. THE CLERK SEVERAL TIMES USED
WHO HAD RESCUED PETYA WAS TALKING TO A FUNCTIONARY ABOUT THE PRIESTS WHO

WIFE WAS SHOWING A RENT IN HER SHAWL AND TELLING HOW MUCH THE SHAWL HAD

PETYA SOON CAME TO HIMSELF, THE COLOR RETURNED TO HIS FACE, THE PAIN HAD

"YOU'VE CRUSHED THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN!" SAID THE CLERK. "WHAT ARE YOU UP

IN FRONT HE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF AN OPEN SPACE WITH A STRIP OF RED CLOTH
TO STRUGGLE DESPERATELY FORWARD, AND FROM BETWEEN THE BACKS OF THOSE
HIM MYSELF--THAT WOULD BE TOO BOLD." BUT IN SPITE OF THIS HE CONTINUED
"SO THIS IS WHAT THE EMPEROR IS!" THOUGHT PETYA. "NO, I CAN'T PETITION

FORWARD AND EVERYBODY SHOUTED "HURRAH!"
ON BOTH SIDES OF HIM OTHER PEOPLE WITH SIMILARLY FEROCIOUS FACES PUSHED
IF HE WERE PREPARED THAT INSTANT TO KILL HIMSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE, BUT
FEROCIOUSLY, PUSHED FORWARD, ELBOWING HIS WAY AND SHOUTING "HURRAH!" AS
QUITE BESIDE HIMSELF, PETYA, CLINCHING HIS TEETH AND ROLLING HIS EYES

FORWARD.
FOR A MOMENT THE CROWD STOOD STILL, BUT THEN IT MADE ANOTHER RUSH

"HURRAH!" WAS HEARD ON ALL SIDES.

WITH HER FINGERS.
"FATHER! ANGEL! DEAR ONE!" SHE KEPT REPEATING, WIPING AWAY HER TEARS

HER CHEEKS.
TRADESMAN'S WIFE STANDING BESIDE PETYA SOBBED, AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN
ALL THE FACES BORE THE SAME EXPRESSION OF EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM. A

NOTHING EXCEPT THE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM.
HURRAH!" PETYA STOOD ON TIPTOE AND PUSHED AND PINCHED, BUT COULD SEE
THAT HE COULD SCARCELY BREATHE, AND EVERYBODY SHOUTED, "HURRAH! HURRAH!
AND EVERYONE RUSHED FORWARD IN ONE DIRECTION. PETYA WAS BEING PRESSED SO
FOR A WHILE THE CROWD WAS LESS DENSE, BUT SUDDENLY ALL HEADS WERE BARED,

VOICES OF THE CROWD THAT FILLED THE WHOLE KREMLIN.
HIMSELF IN THE SQUARE HE CLEARLY HEARD THE SOUND OF BELLS AND THE JOYOUS
BUT EVERYWHERE--ON THE SLOPES AND ON THE ROOFS. AS SOON AS PETYA FOUND
WAS ALREADY FULL OF PEOPLE. THERE WERE PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN THE SQUARE,
CARRYING PETYA WITH IT, STREAMED FORWARD INTO THE KREMLIN SQUARE WHICH
MANLY THING TO DO. WHEN THE CARRIAGES HAD ALL PASSED IN, THE CROWD,
ASKING HIS HELP, BUT CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE A
DROVE PAST WAS AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE ROSTOVS', AND PETYA THOUGHT OF
OR MOVE TO ANOTHER PLACE, BECAUSE OF THE CROWD. ONE OF THE GENERALS WHO
ADMITTED TO THE EMPEROR. BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SMARTEN ONESELF UP
NOW TO APPROACH THE GENTLEMEN-IN-WAITING IN THAT PLIGHT HE WOULD NOT BE
HE FELT THAT HE NO LONGER LOOKED PRESENTABLE, AND FEARED THAT IF HE WERE

COLLAR WHICH HE HAD ARRANGED SO WELL AT HOME TO SEEM LIKE A MAN'S.
PETYA WIPED HIS PERSPIRING FACE WITH HIS HANDS AND PULLED UP THE DAMP

TO SUCH EFFECT THAT HE PUSHED PETYA INTO A VERY FILTHY CORNER OF THE

WORKING HIS WAY WITH HIS ELBOWS, BUT THE WOMAN JUST IN FRONT OF HIM, WHO
WITHOUT WAITING FOR ALL THE CARRIAGES TO PASS, AND HE BEGAN RESOLUTELY
TIME IN THE GATEWAY, PETYA TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS
FOOTMAN, TWO TRADESMEN, AND A DISCHARGED SOLDIER. AFTER STANDING SOME
RUMBLING BENEATH THE ARCHWAY. BESIDE PETYA STOOD A PEASANT WOMAN, A
DETERMINATION HE HAD TO GIVE IN, AND STOP WHILE CARRIAGES PASSED IN,

THE KREMLIN HE EVEN BEGAN TO AVOID BEING CRUSHED AND RESOLUTELY STUCK
TO WALK WITH THE SEDATENESS AND DELIBERATION OF A MAN. AS HE APPROACHED
EVER-INCREASING CROWDS MOVING TOWARD THE KREMLIN, THE LESS HE REMEMBERED
BUT THE FARTHER HE WENT AND THE MORE HIS ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED BY THE
AND BY HIS SEDATE DELIBERATE WALK HE WISHED TO APPEAR A GROWN-UP MAN.
AT HIS YOUTHFULNESS--AND YET IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS COLLAR AND HAIR
IN REACHING THE EMPEROR--HE EVEN THOUGHT HOW SURPRISED EVERYONE WOULD BE
IT WAS ON THE VERY FACT OF BEING SO YOUNG THAT PETYA COUNTED FOR SUCCESS

GENTLEMAN-IN-WAITING.
DRESSING, PETYA HAD PREPARED MANY FINE THINGS HE MEANT TO SAY TO THE
NO HINDRANCE TO LOYALTY, AND THAT HE WAS READY TO... WHILE
IN SPITE OF HIS YOUTH WISHED TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY; THAT YOUTH COULD BE
TO BE ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY GENTLEMEN-IN-WAITING) THAT HE, COUNT ROSTOV,
TO EXPLAIN FRANKLY TO SOME GENTLEMAN-IN-WAITING (HE IMAGINED THE EMPEROR

COLLAR TO LOOK LIKE A GROWN-UP MAN. HE FROWNED BEFORE HIS LOOKING GLASS,
MORNING PETYA WAS A LONG TIME DRESSING AND ARRANGING HIS HAIR AND
DOMESTIC SERFS BEGGED PERMISSION TO GO TO HAVE A LOOK AT HIM. THAT
NEXT DAY THE EMPEROR ARRIVED IN MOSCOW, AND SEVERAL OF THE ROSTOVS'

NOTICE ANYTHING.
SILENT, MOROSE, AND WITH TEAR-STAINED FACE, EVERYBODY PRETENDED NOT TO

AFTER THE DEFINITE REFUSAL HE HAD RECEIVED, PETYA WENT TO HIS ROOM


CHAPTER XXI





PIERRE MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO GO TO THE ROSTOVS' ANY MORE.

KISSED HER HAND AND WENT OUT.
TO SMILE BUT COULD NOT: HIS SMILE EXPRESSED SUFFERING, AND HE SILENTLY
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH DISMAYED AND EMBARRASSED FACES. HE TRIED

"BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!" WAS WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY, BUT HE DID NOT SAY IT,

CHALLENGINGLY INTO PIERRE'S EYES.
"WHY ARE YOU GOING? WHY ARE YOU UPSET?" ASKED NATASHA, AND SHE LOOKED

"WELL, THEN, AU REVOIR!" SAID THE COUNT, AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM.

PIERRE HURRIEDLY.
"YES, I HAD FORGOTTEN... I REALLY MUST GO HOME... BUSINESS..." SAID

AT THIS MOMENT, PETYA, TO WHOM NOBODY WAS PAYING ANY ATTENTION, CAME UP

"NEVER MIND WHAT IT'S FOR...."

"BUT DID YOU NOTICE, IT SAYS, 'FOR CONSULTATION'?" SAID PIERRE.

"A JOKE INDEED!" PUT IN THE COUNT. "LET HIM BUT SAY THE WORD AND WE'LL

ONESELF TO GOD, WHOM SHE FELT GUIDING HER SOUL AT THOSE MOMENTS. SHE
UNDERSTAND ALL, THAT IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO BELIEVE AND TO COMMIT
THE WISH TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING IS PRIDE, THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO

PERSONAL FEELING BECAME INTERWOVEN IN THE PRAYERS WITH SHADES OF ITS

BY AGRAFENA IVANOVNA'S ADVICE NATASHA PREPARED HERSELF NOT IN THEIR

ENTRUSTED HER TO BELOVA. AGRAFENA IVANOVNA USED TO COME TO WAKE NATASHA

MIGHT HELP HER DAUGHTER MORE THAN MEDICINES AND, THOUGH NOT WITHOUT
THE MEDICAL TREATMENT, IN THE DEPTHS OF HER HEART SHE HOPED THAT PRAYER

MATINS, OR MASS.

ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN OF WHICH SHE HAD KNOWN
PART, STILL LESS ON HIS, OR EVEN TO THE KIND OF TENDER, SELF-CONSCIOUS,
THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HIM AND HERSELF COULD LEAD TO LOVE ON HER
WHICH SHE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH KURAGIN THAT IT NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD
NATASHA FELT VERY STRONGLY WITH HIM THAT MORAL BARRIER THE ABSENCE OF
A CRYING CHILD. IT WAS NOT BECAUSE PIERRE WAS A MARRIED MAN, BUT BECAUSE
HER, WERE SPOKEN AS ALL SORTS OF MEANINGLESS WORDS ARE SPOKEN TO COMFORT
AND IT SEEMED PLAIN TO HER THAT THOSE WORDS, WHICH HAD THEN SO COMFORTED
SO STRONGLY AGITATED, PIERRE NEVER SPOKE TO NATASHA OF HIS FEELINGS;
ON HIS KNEES FOR HER HAND AND HER LOVE--UTTERED AT A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS
AFTER THOSE INVOLUNTARY WORDS--THAT IF HE WERE FREE HE WOULD HAVE ASKED
WHICH SHE IMAGINED MUST BE THE SAME TOWARD EVERYONE AS IT WAS TO HER.
NOTICED THIS AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO HIS GENERAL KINDNESS AND SHYNESS,
SOMETHING THEY SPOKE OF WOULD AWAKEN MEMORIES DISTRESSING TO HER. SHE
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO PLEASE HER, OR FEARED THAT
NOTICED EMBARRASSMENT AND AWKWARDNESS ON HIS PART IN HER PRESENCE,
TO EVERYONE THAT THERE WAS NO MERIT IN HIS KINDNESS. SOMETIMES NATASHA
SEEMED TO HER TO BE AN EFFORT, IT SEEMED SO NATURAL FOR HIM TO BE KIND
SHE WAS NOT EVEN GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR IT; NOTHING GOOD ON PIERRE'S PART
FELT THIS DELICACY AND SO FOUND GREAT PLEASURE IN HIS SOCIETY. BUT
SAME TIME MORE SERIOUSLY THAN DID COUNT BEZUKHOV. NATASHA UNCONSCIOUSLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO TREAT HER WITH MORE DELICACY, GREATER CARE, AND AT THE
TO SEE THEM WAS GLAD TO SEE ONLY ONE PERSON, PIERRE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SOMETIMES LAUGHED. SHE HARDLY EVER LEFT THE HOUSE AND OF THOSE WHO CAME
BE WITH HIM BETTER THAN WITH THE OTHERS, AND WHEN ALONE WITH HIM SHE
THE HOUSE AND FELT AT EASE ONLY WITH HER BROTHER PETYA. SHE LIKED TO
ANYONE, BUT WANTED NOTHING FOR HERSELF. SHE KEPT AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN
PASSING. NATASHA APPARENTLY TRIED NOT TO BE A BURDEN OR A HINDRANCE TO
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO COME. THERE WAS NO JOY IN LIFE, YET LIFE WAS
THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH. SHE KNEW THAT, AND ASKED HERSELF, "WHAT NEXT?"
IMAGINED, BUT WORSE, MUCH WORSE, THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD. BUT
IT COMFORTED HER TO REFLECT THAT SHE WAS NOT BETTER AS SHE HAD FORMERLY

ON.
FOR ANY ENJOYMENT WOULD NOT RETURN AGAIN. YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO LIVE
THE TIME HAD NOT DECEIVED HER--THAT THAT STATE OF FREEDOM AND READINESS
SINGLE DAY OF THAT TIME! BUT IT WAS GONE FOREVER. HER PRESENTIMENT AT

HOLIDAYS SPENT WITH NICHOLAS AT OTRADNOE WERE WHAT SHE RECALLED OFTENEST
OF HOPE. THE PREVIOUS AUTUMN, THE HUNTING, "UNCLE," AND THE CHRISTMAS
THE OLD INTERESTS OF HER CAREFREE GIRLISH LIFE THAT HAD BEEN SO FULL
SENTINEL WITHIN HER AND FORBADE HER EVERY JOY. BESIDES, SHE HAD LOST ALL
MAN WAS MORE TO HER THAN NASTASYA IVANOVNA, THE BUFFOON. SOMETHING STOOD

USELESSLY HAVE RUINED HER YOUNG LIFE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY.

NEVER LAUGHED WITHOUT A SOUND OF TEARS IN HER LAUGHTER. SHE COULD NOT

RAEVSKI'S TENDER PATERNAL FEELINGS WHEN THEIR OWN SKINS WERE IN DANGER?

HIS SONS THERE, IT COULD HAVE HAD NO EFFECT EXCEPT PERHAPS ON SOME DOZEN

BECAUSE THEY HAD TO LEAVE BILLETS THEY HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO, OR SOME

HEATED IN A FIGHT WHO STRIKES THOSE ON HIS OWN SIDE, SHOUTED ANGRILY AT

RESULTING FROM DEVIATIONS IN PRACTICE FROM THE THEORY ONLY PROVED TO HIM

ABSOLUTE TRUTH.
TRUTH--SCIENCE--WHICH HE HIMSELF HAS INVENTED BUT WHICH IS FOR HIM THE
REPULSIVE THAN ANY OTHER, BECAUSE HE IMAGINES THAT HE KNOWS THE
GERMAN'S SELF-ASSURANCE IS WORST OF ALL, STRONGER AND MORE
ANYTHING, SINCE HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING CAN BE KNOWN. THE
IS SELF-ASSURED JUST BECAUSE HE KNOWS NOTHING AND DOES NOT WANT TO KNOW
HE IS EXCITABLE AND EASILY FORGETS HIMSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE. A RUSSIAN
AN ENGLISHMAN IS UNDOUBTEDLY CORRECT. AN ITALIAN IS SELF-ASSURED BECAUSE
ENGLISHMAN ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT HE SHOULD DO AND KNOWS THAT ALL HE DOES AS
CITIZEN OF THE BEST-ORGANIZED STATE IN THE WORLD, AND THEREFORE AS AN
ATTRACTIVE TO MEN AND WOMEN. AN ENGLISHMAN IS SELF-ASSURED, AS BEING A

WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE VERY BEST ONE TRAMMELED BY THE PRESENCE AND
PERSONAL SAFETY, AND THAT THE WORST COMMANDER IN CHIEF IF INDEPENDENT
PARALYZED THE ACTION OF FIFTY THOUSAND MEN REQUIRED TO SECURE HIS
AND HIS COURT TO LEAVE THE ARMY; THAT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE EMPEROR
ARMY, AND THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE POSITION WOULD BE FOR THE EMPEROR
HARMFUL IN AN ARMY; THAT A SOVEREIGN SHOULD REIGN BUT NOT COMMAND THE
AND UNSTEADY FLUCTUATION OF RELATIONS, WHICH IS IN PLACE AT COURT BUT

THOSE CONFLICTING OPINIONS, WERE ABLE TO TAKE A DETACHED VIEW OF WHAT
EXPERIENCED AND CAPABLE IN STATE AFFAIRS, WHO, WITHOUT SHARING ANY OF

DRONES, WITHOUT HAVING FINISHED THEIR BUZZING ON A PREVIOUS THEME, FLEW
OBSCURITY TO THE COMMON TASK. WHATEVER QUESTION AROSE, A SWARM OF THESE
PREOCCUPIED WITH PERSONAL INTERESTS IMPARTED GREAT CONFUSION AND
OF RACE AMONG THESE PEOPLE--THIS EIGHTH AND LARGEST PARTY OF THOSE
INTRIGUE, EGOTISM, CONFLICT OF VIEWS AND FEELINGS, AND THE DIVERSITY
A PECULIARLY THREATENING CHARACTER TO EVERYTHING, AMID THIS VORTEX OF
UNCERTAINTIES OF THE POSITION, WITH THE MENACE OF SERIOUS DANGER GIVING

EMPEROR, WOULD STUBBORNLY INSIST ON THE CORRECTNESS OR FALSITY OF SOME
EYE. A FIFTH, TO ACHIEVE HIS LONG-CHERISHED AIM OF DINING WITH THE
OVERWHELMED WITH WORK WOULD OFTEN COME ACCIDENTALLY UNDER THE EMPEROR'S
MOMENT PEOPLE WOULD BE TOO BUSY TO REFUSE HIM. A FOURTH WHILE SEEMINGLY
A SPECIAL GRATUITY FOR HIS FAITHFUL SERVICES, WELL KNOWING THAT AT THAT
IN THE ABSENCE OF OPPONENTS, BETWEEN TWO COUNCILS WOULD SIMPLY SOLICIT
THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR THE COMMON GOOD. A THIRD,
CHALLENGING THOSE WHO DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM TO DUELS, THEREBY PROVING
AND WOULD DISPUTE AND SHOUT AT THE COUNCIL, BEATING HIS BREAST AND
ADVOCATING THE VERY THING THE EMPEROR HAD HINTED AT THE DAY BEFORE,
GAIN SOME ADVANTAGE WOULD ATTRACT THE EMPEROR'S ATTENTION BY LOUDLY
THAT HE HAD NO OPINION AT ALL ON THE MATTER. ANOTHER WHO WISHED TO
MERELY TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY OR TO PLEASE THE EMPEROR, WOULD DECLARE
TODAY AGREE WITH PFUEL, TOMORROW WITH HIS OPPONENT, AND THE DAY AFTER,
OTHER TIMES. A MAN WHO SIMPLY WISHED TO RETAIN HIS LUCRATIVE POST WOULD

ANY DEFEATS, WE OWE THIS ENTIRELY TO BARCLAY. IF BARCLAY IS NOW TO
ORGANIZED AND STRONG AND HAS WITHDRAWN TO DRISSA WITHOUT SUFFERING
HE WILL SHOW WHAT HE CAN DO, AS HE DID IN FINLAND. IF OUR ARMY IS WELL
FOR WAR CANNOT BE CONDUCTED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT UNITY OF COMMAND, AND

"AH, MY GOD! MY GOD! WHEN ONE THINKS WHO AND WHAT--WHAT TRASH--CAN CAUSE

"THANK GOD THAT I CAN," REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW. "I AM VERY SORRY YOU

SOON AS POSSIBLE.
AND HE HASTENED TO ESCAPE FROM THESE MEMORIES AND TO FIND SOME WORK AS

ESPECIALLY ON RETURNING TO THE OLD CONDITIONS OF LIFE AMID WHICH HE HAD
AS SOON AS PRINCE ANDREW HAD GIVEN UP HIS DAILY OCCUPATIONS, AND

OF THE ROOM.
PRINCE ANDREW, WITHOUT REPLYING, PUT HIM DOWN FROM HIS KNEE AND WENT OUT

"WELL, GO ON!" SAID HIS SON.

WHICH HE HAD HOPED TO REAWAKEN BY CARESSING THE BOY AND TAKING HIM ON
HE SOUGHT AND DID NOT FIND IN HIMSELF THE FORMER TENDERNESS FOR HIS SON

AT LEAVING HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE ON BAD TERMS WITH HIM,
SOUGHT IN HIMSELF EITHER REMORSE FOR HAVING ANGERED HIS FATHER OR REGRET

BUT THEN HE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND CRIED: "BE OFF, BE OFF! LET NOT A

ALWAYS LIABLE TO DO OF LATE--"I CAN ONLY SAY THAT IF THERE ARE ANY

THERE IS ANY MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISCORD BETWEEN YOU AND MARY, I CAN'T

DIVIDED INTO TWO ALIEN AND HOSTILE CAMPS, WHO CHANGED THEIR HABITS FOR

ALL REMAINED AS OF OLD, THE INNER RELATIONS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD

HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. LITTLE NICHOLAS ALONE HAD CHANGED. HE HAD GROWN,
EVER, ONLY SHOWING STILL MORE IRRITABILITY AND SKEPTICISM AS TO WHAT WAS
NOTICEABLE GAP ON ONE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH; IN CHARACTER HE WAS THE SAME AS
HAD CHANGED IN APPEARANCE ONLY BY THE LOSS OF A TOOTH, WHICH LEFT A
INTELLIGENT, CONSCIENTIOUS, AND PEDANTIC PRECEPTOR. THE OLD PRINCE
TALKING BROKEN RUSSIAN TO THE SERVANTS, BUT WAS STILL THE SAME NARROWLY
BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND, WAS WEARING A COAT OF RUSSIAN CUT AND
MORE SELF-CONFIDENT, PRINCE ANDREW THOUGHT. DESSALLES, THE TUTOR HE HAD
EXISTENCE AND FULL OF JOYOUS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE. SHE HAD MERELY BECOME
THE SAME COQUETTISH, SELF-SATISFIED GIRL, ENJOYING EVERY MOMENT OF HER
HER LIFE IN FEAR AND CONSTANT SUFFERING. MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE WAS
GETTING ON IN YEARS, USELESSLY AND JOYLESSLY PASSING THE BEST YEARS OF
SOMEWHAT OLDER. PRINCESS MARY WAS STILL THE SAME TIMID, PLAIN MAIDEN
THE SAME WALLS, SOUNDS, AND SMELL, AND THE SAME TIMID FACES, ONLY
SAME STILLNESS REIGNED THERE, AND INSIDE THERE WAS THE SAME FURNITURE,
SLEEPING CASTLE. THE SAME OLD STATELINESS, THE SAME CLEANLINESS, THE
THE AVENUE LEADING TO THE HOUSE AS IF HE WERE ENTERING AN ENCHANTED,
HE ENTERED THROUGH THE GATES WITH THEIR STONE PILLARS AND DROVE UP
THE WAY OF LIFE THERE UNCHANGED AND STILL THE SAME IN EVERY DETAIL.
ON REACHING BALD HILLS IT STRUCK HIM AS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED TO FIND
AND SEEN SO MUCH (HAVING TRAVELED BOTH IN THE EAST AND THE WEST), THAT
YEARS THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY CHANGES IN HIS LIFE, HE HAD THOUGHT, FELT,
BEING ONLY TWO MILES OFF THE SMOLENSK HIGHROAD. DURING THE LAST THREE

BE ABLE TO RESIST CALLING HIM OUT, ANY MORE THAN A RAVENOUS MAN CAN HELP
TO A CONFLICT WITH HIM--HE KNEW THAT WHEN HE DID MEET HIM HE WOULD NOT

BE BEFORE HE MET KURAGIN, DESPITE HIS CONTEMPT FOR HIM AND DESPITE ALL
TO RUSSIA AFTER HIM, BUT ALL THE SAME HE KNEW THAT HOWEVER LONG IT MIGHT

KUTUZOV BY HIS WILLINGNESS AND ACCURACY IN WORK. NOT HAVING FOUND
HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO BUSINESS WITH ZEAL AND PERSEVERANCE AND SURPRISED

EAGERLY THE MORE THOSE PAST INTERESTS WERE CLOSED TO HIM. IT WAS AS IF
MATTERS UNRELATED TO HIS PAST INTERESTS, AND HE SEIZED ON THESE THE MORE
THEY HAD REVEALED. HE WAS NOW CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE NEAREST PRACTICAL
BUT HE EVEN DREADED TO RECALL THEM AND THE BRIGHT AND BOUNDLESS HORIZONS
HAD FILLED HIS SOLITUDE AT BOGUCHAROVO AND THEN IN SWITZERLAND AND ROME,
FIELD OF AUSTERLITZ AND HAD LATER ENLARGED UPON WITH PIERRE, AND WHICH
THOUGHTS THAT HAD FIRST COME TO HIM AS HE LAY GAZING AT THE SKY ON THE

AND THE WAR BEGAN...
EVERY DETAIL OF THE INTERVIEW WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE RUSSIAN MONARCH,
THE LETTER TAKEN BY BALASHEV WAS THE LAST NAPOLEON SENT TO ALEXANDER.

IN REPLY TO BALASHEV'S BOW. "LET HIM HAVE MINE, HE HAS A LONG WAY TO
READY FOR THE GENERAL?" HE ADDED, WITH A SLIGHT INCLINATION OF HIS HEAD
ADORER AND COURTIER OF ANYONE BUT HIMSELF, NAPOLEON. "ARE THE HORSES
ANYTHING?" SAID HE, AS IF IT WAS RIDICULOUS, IN HIS PRESENCE, TO BE THE
"WELL, ADORER AND COURTIER OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER, WHY DON'T YOU SAY

TO HAVE ONE'S EAR PULLED BY THE EMPEROR WAS CONSIDERED THE GREATEST

FACE AND, TAKING HIM BY THE EAR, PULLED IT GENTLY, SMILING WITH HIS LIPS
BALASHEV, HE RAISED HIS HAND TO THE FORTY-YEAR-OLD RUSSIAN GENERAL'S
AS IF HE WERE DOING SOMETHING NOT MERELY IMPORTANT BUT PLEASING TO
BALASHEV AND WITH A SLIGHT SMILE, AS CONFIDENTLY, QUICKLY, AND SIMPLY
THE ROOM IN SILENCE, AND THEN, SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY, WENT UP TO

AND NOT TO COMMAND ARMIES! WHY HAS HE TAKEN ON HIMSELF SUCH A

"AND WHY HAS THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER TAKEN COMMAND OF THE ARMIES? WHAT IS

HUMILIATION.
NOW FULLY DEVOTED TO HIM AND WHO MUST REJOICE AT HIS FORMER MASTER'S
HE TREATED BALASHEV NOT AS AN ENVOY FROM HIS ENEMY, BUT AS A MAN
HEARING WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM. NAPOLEON DID NOT NOTICE THIS EXPRESSION;
MAKE HIS BOW AND LEAVE, AND ONLY LISTENED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HELP
BALASHEV BOWED HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR INDICATING THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO

PREPARE AN ASYLUM FOR THEM IN RUSSIA!"
WEIMAR RELATIONS OUT OF GERMANY.... YES. I'LL DRIVE THEM OUT. LET HIM
HIS CUP AWAY WITH HIS HAND. "I'LL DRIVE ALL HIS WURTTEMBERG, BADEN, AND
"AND LET HIM KNOW THAT I WILL DO SO!" SAID NAPOLEON, RISING AND PUSHING

IN HIM.
HIM BACK ON TO THE TRACK OF HIS MORNING'S ANGER, WHICH WAS STILL FRESH
AND HE TURNED INQUIRINGLY TO BALASHEV, AND EVIDENTLY THIS THOUGHT TURNED
THAT I DO NOT... UNDERSTAND. HAS HE NOT THOUGHT THAT I MAY DO THE SAME?"
THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER HAS SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH MY PERSONAL ENEMIES.
SELF-CONFIDENT SMILE. "WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND," HE WENT ON, "IS THAT
DELIBERATING," CONTINUED NAPOLEON WITH THE SAME DERISIVE AND
"YES. FOUR DAYS AGO IN THIS ROOM, WINTZINGERODE AND STEIN WERE

"THEY TELL ME THIS IS THE ROOM THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER OCCUPIED? STRANGE,

PLEASANT, THOUGH SLIGHTLY IRONIC, SMILE.
BALASHEV TOO WAS HIS FRIEND AND WORSHIPER. NAPOLEON TURNED TO HIM WITH A

CONSIDER EVERYONE HIS FRIEND. IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS SURROUNDED

THAT MOSCOW IS CALLED 'HOLY MOSCOW'? HOW MANY CHURCHES ARE THERE IN

IF CONVINCED THAT BALASHEV, AS A RUSSIAN, MUST BE FLATTERED BY HIS
INTERESTED TRAVELER ASKS ABOUT A NEW CITY HE INTENDS TO VISIT, BUT AS
QUESTIONED BALASHEV ABOUT THE RUSSIAN CAPITAL, NOT MERELY AS AN
HIS SUCCESS. IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION HE MENTIONED MOSCOW AND
ONE OF THOSE WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS PLANS AND OUGHT TO REJOICE AT
HIM AMIABLY BUT BEHAVED AS IF BALASHEV WERE ONE OF HIS OWN COURTIERS,
AT DINNER, HAVING PLACED BALASHEV BESIDE HIM, NAPOLEON NOT ONLY TREATED

THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS TO HIM.
MONOGRAM WERE DISPLAYED, AND THE POLISH LADIES, WELCOMING HIM, WAVED
THE WINDOWS OF THE STREETS THROUGH WHICH HE RODE, RUGS, FLAGS, AND HIS
CROWDS OF PEOPLE HAD RAPTUROUSLY GREETED AND FOLLOWED HIM. FROM ALL
THE EMPEROR WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS AFTER HIS RIDE THROUGH VILNA, WHERE

DID IT.
BECAUSE IT HARMONIZED WITH ANY IDEA OF RIGHT AND WRONG, BUT BECAUSE HE
MISTAKE, AND THAT IN HIS PERCEPTION WHATEVER HE DID WAS RIGHT, NOT
HE HAD LONG BEEN CONVINCED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE A
BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, TRIED TO REASSURE BALASHEV. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT
OF CONSTRAINT OR SELF-REPROACH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OUTBURST THAT MORNING,
NAPOLEON MET BALASHEV CHEERFULLY AND AMIABLY. HE NOT ONLY SHOWED NO SIGN

BESSIERES, CAULAINCOURT, AND BERTHIER WERE PRESENT AT THAT DINNER.

WITH THE EMPEROR THAT DAY.
TO HIS SURPRISE, BALASHEV RECEIVED, THROUGH DUROC, AN INVITATION TO DINE
INSULTED ENVOY--ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD WITNESSED HIS UNSEEMLY ANGER. BUT,
NOT WISH TO SEE HIM, AND WOULD EVEN AVOID ANOTHER MEETING WITH HIM--AN

ESTEEM HIS LOFTY QUALITIES. I WILL DETAIN YOU NO LONGER, GENERAL; YOU
I AM AS DEVOTED TO HIM AS BEFORE: I KNOW HIM THOROUGHLY AND VERY HIGHLY

WITHOUT GIVING THEM A GLANCE, TURNED TO BALASHEV:
HIS HAT AND GLOVES; ANOTHER BROUGHT HIM A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF. NAPOLEON,

ENERGETICALLY WITH HIS WHITE HANDS, ALMOST SHOUTED:
ROUND, DREW CLOSE TO BALASHEV'S FACE, AND, GESTICULATING RAPIDLY AND

HE SHRANK BEFORE THE TRANSPORT OF GROUNDLESS WRATH THAT HAD EVIDENTLY

IN THE RIGHT. BALASHEV BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE: AS ENVOY HE FEARED
A MAN HAS TO TALK, TALK, AND TALK, MERELY TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT HE IS
TO DROWN HIS VOICE. NAPOLEON WAS IN THAT STATE OF IRRITABILITY IN WHICH
SWEDEN IS PRACTICALLY AN ISLAND: BUT NAPOLEON GAVE AN ANGRY EXCLAMATION
OF THE SWEDES, BALASHEV WISHED TO REPLY THAT WHEN RUSSIA IS ON HER SIDE

"YES... I WILL TELL HIM," ANSWERED PIERRE; "BUT..."

"HE IS HERE NOW: TELL HIM... TO FOR... FORGIVE ME!" SHE STOPPED AND

SORRY FOR HER THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM IN HIS SOUL FOR REPROACH.

LATER SONYA CAME TO MARYA DMITRIEVNA.
INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW PRINCE ANDREW HAD TAKEN THE NEWS. TEN MINUTES
AFTER GIVING THE LETTERS TO SONYA, WENT TO MARYA DMITRIEVNA WHO WAS
ENTRUSTED TO HIM. NATASHA WAS IN BED, THE COUNT AT THE CLUB, AND PIERRE,
THAT SAME EVENING PIERRE WENT TO THE ROSTOVS' TO FULFILL THE COMMISSION

THE CAUSE OF WHICH PIERRE SO WELL UNDERSTOOD.
NOW WITH THE SWISS TUTOR DESSALLES, AND SHOWING AN UNNATURAL ANIMATION,

AT DINNER THE TALK TURNED ON THE WAR, THE APPROACH OF WHICH WAS BECOMING

THE NAME OF HER WHO COULD GIVE UP PRINCE ANDREW FOR ANYONE ELSE.
ROSTOVS, AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN THEIR PRESENCE EVEN TO MENTION
PIERRE REALIZED WHAT CONTEMPT AND ANIMOSITY THEY ALL FELT FOR THE
SATISFACTION THAT THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF. LOOKING AT THEM
ALWAYS, BUT BENEATH HER SYMPATHY FOR HER BROTHER, PIERRE NOTICED HER
THE OLD MAN SEEMED LIVELIER THAN USUAL. PRINCESS MARY WAS THE SAME AS

PIERRE LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO THE OLD PRINCE AND PRINCESS MARY.

YOU'LL GIVE HER THE PACKET?"
MY FRIEND NEVER SPEAK TO ME OF THAT... OF ALL THAT! WELL, GOOD-BY. SO
I AM UNABLE TO FOLLOW IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FOOTSTEPS. IF YOU WISH TO BE
AGAIN, BE MAGNANIMOUS, AND SO ON?... YES, THAT WOULD BE VERY NOBLE, BUT
PRINCE ANDREW INTERRUPTED HIM AND CRIED SHARPLY: "YES, ASK HER HAND

"BUT CAN THIS BE COMPARED...?" SAID PIERRE.

SHOULD BE FORGIVEN, BUT I DIDN'T SAY I COULD FORGIVE HER. I CAN'T."
"YES," RETURNED PRINCE ANDREW HASTILY. "I SAID THAT A FALLEN WOMAN

"ABOUT..."
"I SAY, DO YOU REMEMBER OUR DISCUSSION IN PETERSBURG?" ASKED PIERRE,

ANYTHING, LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIM.
HE HAD SOMETHING MORE TO SAY, OR WAITING TO SEE IF PIERRE WOULD SAY

THAT SHE WAS AND IS PERFECTLY FREE AND THAT I WISH HER ALL THAT IS
"WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER," SAID PRINCE ANDREW. "TELL COUNTESS ROSTOVA

"HE HAS GONE TO PETERS... BUT I DON'T KNOW," SAID PIERRE.

"AND WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW NOW, IF I MAY ASK?" HE SAID.

PRINCE ANDREW LAUGHED DISAGREEABLY, AGAIN REMINDING ONE OF HIS FATHER.

"HE COULD NOT MARRY, FOR HE WAS MARRIED ALREADY," SAID PIERRE.

SAID PRINCE ANDREW, AND HE SNORTED SEVERAL TIMES.
"SO MONSIEUR KURAGIN HAS NOT HONORED COUNTESS ROSTOVA WITH HIS HAND?"

FATHER, COLDLY, MALICIOUSLY, AND UNPLEASANTLY.
"I MUCH REGRET HER ILLNESS," SAID PRINCE ANDREW; AND HE SMILED LIKE HIS

ADDED QUICKLY.
"THEN SHE IS HERE STILL?" SAID PRINCE ANDREW. "AND PRINCE KURAGIN?" HE

"SHE IS VERY ILL," SAID PIERRE.

"GIVE THIS TO THE COUNTESS... IF YOU SEE HER."

HE TOOK THE PACKET FROM THE TABLE AND HANDED IT TO PIERRE.

"HERE ARE HER LETTERS AND HER PORTRAIT," SAID HE.

"BOTH TRUE AND UNTRUE," PIERRE BEGAN; BUT PRINCE ANDREW INTERRUPTED HIM.

IN ORDER TO STIFLE THOUGHTS THAT WERE TOO OPPRESSIVE AND TOO INTIMATE.

SOME DAYS AFTER ANATOLE'S DEPARTURE PIERRE RECEIVED A NOTE FROM PRINCE

NATASHA HAD BROKEN OFF HER ENGAGEMENT. HE SEEMED IN BETTER SPIRITS THAN
MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE AND HAD READ THE NOTE TO PRINCESS MARY IN WHICH

NEXT DAY ANATOLE LEFT FOR PETERSBURG.

"OH, VILE AND HEARTLESS BROOD!" HE EXCLAIMED, AND LEFT THE ROOM.

PIERRE KNEW SO WELL IN HIS WIFE, REVOLTED HIM.

PIERRE TOOK THE LETTER ANATOLE HANDED HIM AND, PUSHING ASIDE A TABLE

ANATOLE GLANCED AT HIM AND IMMEDIATELY THRUST HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET

EVERYONE ABOUT ANATOLE. ONE MAN TOLD HIM HE HAD NOT COME YET, AND
SAID IT WAS NONSENSE FOR HE HAD JUST COME FROM THE ROSTOVS'. HE ASKED
WHICH WAS TALKED OF IN THE TOWN, AND WAS IT TRUE? PIERRE LAUGHED AND
THE WEATHER, ASKED IF HE HAD HEARD OF KURAGIN'S ABDUCTION OF ROSTOVA

THEY SHOULD LEAVE HER ALONE.
SHE WAS EVIDENTLY UNABLE TO SPEAK AND MADE A SIGN WITH HER HANDS THAT

"YES, I HAVE JUST SEEN HIM."

"IS HE STILL HERE?" SHE ASKED, QUICKLY.

PIERRE GAVE HIS WORD OF HONOR.

"HAS HE BEEN MARRIED LONG?" SHE ASKED. "ON YOUR HONOR?..."

"YES, IT IS TRUE."

"THEN IT IS NOT TRUE THAT HE'S MARRIED!"

TRUE OR NOT SHOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU, BECAUSE..."

PROMISED BOLKONSKI. HE WAS GLAD I WAS FREE TO REFUSE HIM."
"OH, SONYA, IF YOU KNEW HIM AS I DO! HE SAID... HE ASKED ME WHAT I HAD

NATASHA BECAME THOUGHTFUL.

ANGRY WITH ME! TELL ME EVERYTHING--THE WHOLE TRUTH. WHAT DID HE SAY?"
"WELL, WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT DID HE SAY? NATASHA, HOW GLAD I AM YOU'RE NOT

PRAISED. "WE HAVE HAD AN EXPLANATION TODAY."
NATASHA BEGAN IN A MILD VOICE SUCH AS CHILDREN USE WHEN THEY WISH TO BE
"THERE, SONYA, YOU WERE TALKING ALL SORTS OF NONSENSE ABOUT HIM,"

BEGIN THE EXPLANATION SONYA EXPECTED.
MORE AGITATED THAN EVER. WHEN THEY GOT HOME NATASHA WAS THE FIRST TO
TO HIM, TRYING NOT TO BE OVERHEARD, AND THAT ALL THROUGH DINNER SHE WAS
THAT PARTY NATASHA AGAIN MET ANATOLE, AND SONYA NOTICED THAT SHE SPOKE
DINNER PARTY AT THE KARAGINS', AND MARYA DMITRIEVNA TOOK THEM THERE. AT
ON THE DAY THE COUNT LEFT, SONYA AND NATASHA WERE INVITED TO A BIG

THE COUNT WENT WITH THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER TO HIS ESTATE NEAR MOSCOW.
ON FRIDAY THE ROSTOVS WERE TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY, BUT ON WEDNESDAY


AT THAT MOMENT THIS ALL SEEMED QUITE EASY, SIMPLE, AND CLEAR TO NATASHA.
IF SHE HAD BEEN TO BLAME TOWARD HER, BUT THAT SHE COULD NOT BE HIS WIFE.
FREEDOM, SHE BEGGED PRINCESS MARY TO FORGET EVERYTHING AND FORGIVE HER
MAGNANIMITY OF PRINCE ANDREW WHO WHEN HE WENT ABROAD HAD GIVEN HER HER
MISUNDERSTANDINGS WERE AT AN END; THAT AVAILING HERSELF OF THE
THE MORNING. IN THIS LETTER SHE SAID BRIEFLY THAT ALL THEIR
ANSWER TO PRINCESS MARY WHICH SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO WRITE ALL
NATASHA WENT TO THE TABLE AND WITHOUT A MOMENT'S REFLECTION WROTE THAT

ROOM.
DESPAIR AND REPRESSED IRRITATION. SONYA BURST INTO SOBS AND RAN FROM THE

"NATASHA, I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU. AND WHAT ARE YOU SAYING! THINK OF YOUR

"BUT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM!" CRIED NATASHA.

AND I WILL TELL PAPA!" SAID SONYA RESOLUTELY.
CEASE SEEING YOU; AND IF YOU WON'T DO THIS, I WILL. I WILL WRITE TO HIM,
"IF HE IS AN HONORABLE MAN HE SHOULD EITHER DECLARE HIS INTENTIONS OR

"HE! DISHONORABLE? IF YOU ONLY KNEW!" EXCLAIMED NATASHA.

"BUT IF HE IS DISHONORABLE?"

HIM."
LACK OF COMPREHENSION. "WHY, YOU HAVE READ HIS LETTER AND YOU HAVE SEEN
"DOES HE LOVE ME?" NATASHA REPEATED WITH A SMILE OF PITY AT HER FRIEND'S

"DOES HE LOVE YOU?"

UNDERSTAND?" SHE CRIED.
"SONYA, ONE CAN'T DOUBT HIM! ONE CAN'T, ONE CAN'T! DON'T YOU

BUT NATASHA, GUESSING HER DOUBTS, INTERRUPTED HER IN ALARM.

"IF THERE WERE REASONS..." SHE BEGAN.

SONYA SIGHED AND SHOOK HER HEAD INCREDULOUSLY.

"I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REASONS ARE. BUT THERE MUST BE REASONS!"

TO ANSWER IT.
PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER MIND FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW
NATASHA LOOKED AT SONYA WITH ASTONISHMENT. EVIDENTLY THIS QUESTION

NATASHA, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED WHAT THESE SECRET REASONS CAN BE?"
YOU COMPLETE FREEDOM--IF IT IS REALLY SO; BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
"WHY DOESN'T HE OPENLY ASK FOR YOUR HAND? YOU KNOW PRINCE ANDREW GAVE
"BUT WHY THIS SECRECY? WHY DOESN'T HE COME TO THE HOUSE?" ASKED SONYA.

CONFIDED IN YOU...."
ENTREATED. "REMEMBER NO ONE OUGHT TO INTERFERE IN SUCH MATTERS! I HAVE
"FOR GOD'S SAKE, SONYA, DON'T TELL ANYONE, DON'T TORTURE ME," NATASHA

NATASHA DID NOT ANSWER HER QUESTIONS.

YOU? WHY DOESN'T HE COME TO THE HOUSE?"
"BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU?" SHE ASKED. "WHAT HAS HE SAID TO

HER FRIEND.
WHEN SHE SAW NATASHA'S FRIGHT, SONYA SHED TEARS OF SHAME AND PITY FOR

SEPARATED...."
DECLARED NATASHA. "YOU WANT ME TO BE MISERABLE, YOU WANT US TO BE
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN? FOR GOD'S SAKE... IF YOU TELL, YOU ARE MY ENEMY!"

BURSTING INTO TEARS.
"THEN I WON'T LET IT COME TO THAT... I SHALL TELL!" CRIED SONYA,

UNDERSTAND? I LOVE HIM!"
"I TOLD YOU THAT I HAVE NO WILL," NATASHA REPLIED. "WHY CAN'T YOU

SHE WENT ON, WITH A HORROR AND DISGUST SHE COULD HARDLY CONCEAL.
THIS. THIS SECRET CORRESPONDENCE... HOW COULD YOU LET HIM GO SO FAR?"
"BUT THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING," CRIED SONYA. "I CAN'T LEAVE IT LIKE

CRIED NATASHA WITH A HAPPY YET FRIGHTENED EXPRESSION.
DO. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT CAN I DO? WHAT CAN I DO, SONYA?"
I COULD NOT HELP LOVING HIM. YES, HIS SLAVE! WHATEVER HE ORDERS I SHALL
AS SOON AS I SAW HIM I FELT HE WAS MY MASTER AND I HIS SLAVE, AND THAT
BUT IT'S ONLY NOW THAT I FEEL SUCH LOVE. IT'S NOT THE SAME AS BEFORE.
"I HAD HEARD THAT IT HAPPENS LIKE THIS, AND YOU MUST HAVE HEARD IT TOO,

KISSED HER.
UNDERSTAND IT.... SONYA, WAIT A BIT, SIT HERE," AND NATASHA EMBRACED AND
YEARS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANYONE BEFORE. YOU CAN'T
"THREE DAYS?" SAID NATASHA. "IT SEEMS TO ME I'VE LOVED HIM A HUNDRED

THREE DAYS TO FORGET EVERYTHING AND SO..."

YOU HAVE LOVED A MAN FOR A WHOLE YEAR AND SUDDENLY... WHY, YOU HAVE ONLY
"BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT," INSISTED SONYA. "I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW IS IT

SAID NATASHA, WITH MOMENTARY VEXATION.
"OH, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING! DON'T TALK NONSENSE, JUST LISTEN!"

"WELL, THEN, ARE YOU REFUSING PRINCE ANDREW?" SAID SONYA.

THE QUESTION.
NATASHA LOOKED AT SONYA WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES AS IF SHE COULD NOT GRASP

"BUT, NATASHA, CAN THAT BE ALL OVER?"

KNOW WHAT LOVE IS...."
"AH, SONYA, IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW HAPPY I AM!" CRIED NATASHA. "YOU DON'T

"AND BOLKONSKI?" SHE ASKED.

SONYA STARED OPEN-EYED AT NATASHA, UNABLE TO BELIEVE HER EARS.

SONYA..."
ANY LONGER. YOU KNOW, WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER! SONYA, DARLING, HE WRITES...
"NO, SONYA, I CAN'T ANY LONGER!" SHE SAID. "I CAN'T HIDE IT FROM YOU

NATASHA SMILED RAPTUROUSLY.

"YES," ANSWERED SONYA SOFTLY.

"SONYA, YOU'VE READ THAT LETTER?" SHE DEMANDED.

EMBARRASSMENT, HER OWN FACE EXPRESSED CONFUSION AND SUSPICION.
OF AWAKENING, SHE EMBRACED HER FRIEND, BUT NOTICING SONYA'S LOOK OF

NATASHA AWOKE AND SAW SONYA.

SONYA WIPED AWAY HER TEARS AND WENT UP TO NATASHA, AGAIN SCANNING HER

AFTER REACHING HOME NATASHA DID NOT SLEEP ALL NIGHT. SHE WAS TORMENTED

WITHOUT STAYING FOR SUPPER.
HELENE RETURNED WITH NATASHA TO THE DRAWING ROOM. THE ROSTOVS WENT AWAY

KNOWING WHAT TO SAY AND HE REPEATED IT TILL HELENE CAME UP TO THEM.
"NATALIE, JUST A WORD, ONLY ONE!" HE KEPT REPEATING, EVIDENTLY NOT

PAINFULLY PRESSED. "NATALIE?"

HER AND SPOKEN LAUGHINGLY OF HER BROTHER'S LOVE, AND THAT SHE AGAIN MET
GO TO THE DRESSING ROOM TO REARRANGE HER DRESS, THAT HELENE HAD FOLLOWED
UPON HER. LATER ON SHE RECALLED HOW SHE HAD ASKED HER FATHER TO LET HER
WHEREVER SHE WENT AND WHOMEVER SHE WAS SPEAKING TO, SHE FELT HIS EYES
GROSSVATER. HER FATHER ASKED HER TO COME HOME, BUT SHE BEGGED TO REMAIN.

HE PRESSED HER ARM.
SAW THE FACE, GESTURES, AND TENDER SMILE OF THAT BOLD HANDSOME MAN WHEN
IMAGINATION SHE WENT OVER HER WHOLE CONVERSATION WITH KURAGIN, AND AGAIN
FORMER PURITY OF HER LOVE FOR PRINCE ANDREW HAD PERISHED. AND AGAIN IN
THAT THOUGH ALL THIS WAS TRUE, AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED, YET THE
NATASHA QUIETED HERSELF FOR A MOMENT, BUT AGAIN SOME INSTINCT TOLD HER
ANDREW CAN LOVE ME STILL. BUT WHY 'STILL?' O GOD, WHY ISN'T HE HERE?"
PLAIN THAT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND THERE IS NOTHING TO REPENT OF, AND
WILL KNOW AND I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN," SHE TOLD HERSELF. "SO IT IS
TO ME? NOTHING! I HAVE DONE NOTHING, I DIDN'T LEAD HIM ON AT ALL. NOBODY
SOOTHING IRONY REPLIED: "WHAT A FOOL I AM TO ASK THAT! WHAT DID HAPPEN
"AM I SPOILED FOR ANDREW'S LOVE OR NOT?" SHE ASKED HERSELF, AND WITH

CONFESSION. SO NATASHA TRIED TO SOLVE WHAT WAS TORTURING HER BY HERSELF.
WOULD EITHER NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL OR WOULD BE HORRIFIED AT SUCH A
WAS FEELING. SHE KNEW THAT SONYA WITH HER SEVERE AND SIMPLE VIEWS
ONLY TO THE OLD COUNTESS AT NIGHT IN BED COULD NATASHA HAVE TOLD ALL SHE

NOW?" SHE THOUGHT.
TERROR I FELT OF HIM? WHAT IS THIS GNAWING OF CONSCIENCE I AM FEELING
ALONE BY HERSELF, IT WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. "WHAT IS IT? WHAT WAS THAT
THE PRESENCE OF THAT HELENE IT HAD ALL SEEMED CLEAR AND SIMPLE; BUT NOW,
HELENE WITH HER PROUD, CALM SMILE, RAPTUROUSLY CRIED "BRAVO!"--THERE IN
MUSIC ON WET BOARDS, AND YOUNG GIRLS AND OLD MEN, AND THE NEARLY NAKED
BARE-LEGGED DUPORT, IN A TINSEL-DECORATED JACKET, JUMPED ABOUT TO THE
AND TERRIBLE. THERE IN THAT ENORMOUS, ILLUMINATED THEATER WHERE THE
HAD HAPPENED OR WHAT SHE FELT. EVERYTHING SEEMED DARK, OBSCURE,
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER, BUT WAS UNABLE EITHER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
FOR A LONG TIME HIDING HER FLUSHED FACE IN HER HANDS TRYING TO REALIZE
"O GOD! I AM LOST!" SHE SAID TO HERSELF. "HOW COULD I LET HIM?" SHE SAT

GAVE A LOUD EXCLAMATION, FLUSHED, AND RAN OUT OF THE ROOM.
WAS HORRIFIED, AND AT TEA TO WHICH ALL HAD SAT DOWN AFTER THE OPERA, SHE
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER, AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERING PRINCE ANDREW SHE
ONLY AFTER SHE HAD REACHED HOME WAS NATASHA ABLE CLEARLY TO THINK OVER


SMILING TENDERLY.
FLUSHED SHE TURNED ROUND. HE WAS LOOKING AT HER WITH GLITTERING EYES,
PUTTING NATASHA IN HE PRESSED HER ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW. AGITATED AND
CAME UP TO THEM, CALLED THEIR CARRIAGE, AND HELPED THEM IN. AS HE WAS
SHE COULD NOT HELP WATCHING. AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE THEATER ANATOLE
SHE FELT AGITATED AND TORMENTED, AND THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS KURAGIN WHOM
DOWN BELOW. THAT WAS THE ONLY PART OF THE FOURTH ACT THAT NATASHA SAW.
ABOUT, TILL THE BOARDS WERE WITHDRAWN FROM UNDER HIM AND HE DISAPPEARED
IN THE FOURTH ACT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF DEVIL WHO SANG WAVING HIS ARM

RECUR TO HER MIND AND WERE AS IF BELONGING TO A REMOTE PAST.
BETROTHED, OF PRINCESS MARY, OR OF LIFE IN THE COUNTRY DID NOT ONCE
QUITE NATURAL, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ALL HER PREVIOUS THOUGHTS OF HER
WORLD SHE FOUND HERSELF IN. ALL THAT WAS GOING ON BEFORE HER NOW SEEMED
WENT BACK TO HER FATHER IN THE OTHER BOX, NOW QUITE SUBMISSIVE TO THE
THE CURTAIN ROSE AGAIN. ANATOLE LEFT THE BOX, SERENE AND GAY. NATASHA

HORROR THAT NO BARRIER LAY BETWEEN HIM AND HER.
AS HE WAS DOING, GAZING STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES. AND AGAIN SHE FELT WITH
GOOD-NATURED TENDERNESS OF HIS SMILE VANQUISHED HER. SHE SMILED JUST
STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES, AND HIS NEARNESS, SELF-ASSURANCE, AND THE
HERSELF, AND SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TURNING ROUND. SHE LOOKED
"HOW IS HE NOW? CONFUSED? ANGRY? OUGHT I TO PUT IT RIGHT?" SHE ASKED

HE WAS THERE, BEHIND, SO CLOSE BEHIND HER.
NOT HEARD HIS REMARK. BUT AS SOON AS SHE HAD TURNED AWAY SHE FELT THAT
INTENTION. SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND TURNED AWAY AS IF SHE HAD
HIMSELF, BUT SHE FELT THAT HIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS HAD AN IMPROPER
NATASHA DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING ANY MORE THAN HE DID


    * ARE THE PRETTY WOMEN.


THERE. DO COME, DEAR COUNTESS, AND GIVE ME THIS FLOWER AS A PLEDGE!"
BOUQUET AND DROPPING HIS VOICE, HE ADDED, "YOU WILL BE THE PRETTIEST
COSTUME TOURNAMENT, COUNTESS? DO COME!" AND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO HER
INDEED," HE SAID, LOOKING AT HER SIGNIFICANTLY. "YOU'LL COME TO THE
CE SONT LES JOLIES FEMMES, * ISN'T THAT SO? BUT NOW I LIKE IT VERY MUCH
"AT FIRST I DID NOT LIKE IT MUCH, BECAUSE WHAT MAKES A TOWN PLEASANT

SOMETHING IMPROPER. ANATOLE SMILED AS THOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HER.
BLUSHED. SHE FELT ALL THE TIME THAT BY TALKING TO HIM SHE WAS DOING
SILENCE, ASKED HIM HOW HE LIKED MOSCOW. SHE ASKED THE QUESTION AND
EYES WERE GAZING CALMLY AND FIXEDLY AT HER, NATASHA, TO BREAK THE
DURING ONE OF THESE MOMENTS OF AWKWARD SILENCE WHEN ANATOLE'S PROMINENT

OF IT!"
NOTHING BUT WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAID: "HAVING A GOOD TIME? WELL, I'M GLAD
WITH A GENERAL AND DID NOT ANSWER HER LOOK, AND HER FATHER'S EYES SAID
AS IF ASKING WHAT IT ALL MEANT, BUT HELENE WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
EVER BEEN TO ANY MAN. NATASHA KEPT TURNING TO HELENE AND TO HER FATHER,
THINGS, YET SHE FELT THAT THEY WERE CLOSER TO ONE ANOTHER THAN SHE HAD
BY HER BARE ARM AND KISS HER ON THE NECK. THEY SPOKE OF MOST ORDINARY
THIS MAN. WHEN SHE TURNED AWAY SHE FEARED HE MIGHT SEIZE HER FROM BEHIND
THAT WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SHE HAD COME TO FEEL HERSELF TERRIBLY NEAR TO
ALWAYS FELT BETWEEN HERSELF AND OTHER MEN. SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS
FRIGHTENED, REALIZING THAT THERE WAS NOT THAT BARRIER OF MODESTY SHE HAD
LOOK INTO HERS RATHER THAN THIS. BUT LOOKING INTO HIS EYES SHE WAS
AT HER SHOULDERS, AND SHE INVOLUNTARILY CAUGHT HIS EYE SO THAT HE SHOULD
OPPRESSED. WHEN SHE WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM SHE FELT THAT HE WAS LOOKING
BY HER. THIS PLEASED HER, YET HIS PRESENCE MADE HER FEEL CONSTRAINED AND
NECK, AND HER BARE ARMS. NATASHA KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT HE WAS ENRAPTURED
WHILE SAYING THIS HE NEVER REMOVED HIS SMILING EYES FROM HER FACE, HER

KARAGINS'! PLEASE COME! NO! REALLY, EH?" SAID HE.
OUGHT TO TAKE PART IN IT! IT WILL BE GREAT FUN. WE SHALL ALL MEET AT THE
OLD, FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCE, "WE ARE GETTING UP A COSTUME TOURNAMENT; YOU
"AND DO YOU KNOW, COUNTESS," HE SAID, SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HER AS AN

PREVIOUS PERFORMANCE SEMENOVA HAD FALLEN DOWN ON THE STAGE.
KURAGIN ASKED HER OPINION OF THE PERFORMANCE AND TOLD HER HOW AT A

NAIVE, CHEERFUL, AND GOOD-NATURED.
WHOM THERE WAS SO MUCH TALK, BUT THAT ON THE CONTRARY HIS SMILE WAS MOST
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FORMIDABLE IN THIS MAN ABOUT
HE TALKED BOLDLY AND NATURALLY, AND NATASHA WAS STRANGELY AND AGREEABLY
KURAGIN WAS MUCH MORE SENSIBLE AND SIMPLE WITH WOMEN THAN AMONG MEN.
IN FACT, AT WHICH HE HAD HAD THE WELL-REMEMBERED PLEASURE OF SEEING HER.
HAD LONG WISHED TO HAVE THIS HAPPINESS--EVER SINCE THE NARYSHKINS' BALL
AT CLOSE QUARTERS AS AT A DISTANCE, SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AND TOLD HER HE
AND SMILED AT HIM OVER HER BARE SHOULDER. ANATOLE, WHO WAS AS HANDSOME
NATASHA TURNED HER PRETTY LITTLE HEAD TOWARD THE ELEGANT YOUNG OFFICER

UNEASILY FROM NATASHA TO ANATOLE.
"LET ME INTRODUCE MY BROTHER TO YOU," SAID HELENE, HER EYES SHIFTING

AGAINST ANYONE.
DOOR OPENED, AND ANATOLE ENTERED, STOOPING AND TRYING NOT TO BRUSH
DURING THE ENTR'ACTE A WHIFF OF COLD AIR CAME INTO HELENE'S BOX, THE

"OH, YES," REPLIED NATASHA.

"ISN'T DUPORT DELIGHTFUL?" HELENE ASKED HER.

STRANGE. SHE LOOKED ABOUT WITH PLEASURE, SMILING JOYFULLY.
SHOUTING: "DUPORT! DUPORT! DUPORT!" NATASHA NO LONGER THOUGHT THIS
CLATTER AMONG THE AUDIENCE, AND WITH RAPTUROUS FACES EVERYONE BEGAN
AND THE CURTAIN DROPPED. ONCE MORE THERE WAS A TERRIBLE NOISE AND
ORCHESTRA, EVERYONE RAN OFF, AGAIN DRAGGING ONE OF THEIR NUMBER AWAY,
CAME ON, CHROMATIC SCALES AND DIMINISHED SEVENTHS WERE HEARD IN THE
SOUND OF MUSIC, AND THEY ALL BEGAN SINGING. BUT SUDDENLY A STORM
AND WOMEN DANCED WITH BARE LEGS. THEN THE KING AGAIN SHOUTED TO THE
MAN STOPPED AND BEGAN SMILING AND BOWING TO ALL SIDES. THEN OTHER MEN
AND GALLERIES BEGAN CLAPPING AND SHOUTING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT, AND THE
THOUSAND RUBLES A YEAR FOR THIS ART.) EVERYBODY IN THE STALLS, BOXES,
WAVED HIS FEET ABOUT VERY RAPIDLY. (HE WAS DUPORT, WHO RECEIVED SIXTY
STRUCK UP MORE LOUDLY, AND THIS MAN WITH BARE LEGS JUMPED VERY HIGH AND
INTO A CORNER OF THE STAGE. THE CYMBALS AND HORNS IN THE ORCHESTRA
STALLS EVERYONE CLAPPED AND SHOUTED "BRAVO!" THEN ONE OF THE MEN WENT
BEGAN JUMPING AND STRIKING ONE FOOT RAPIDLY AGAINST THE OTHER. IN THE
WINGS, ADJUSTED HER BODICE, RETURNED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE, AND
BARE LEGS AND THIN ARMS, SEPARATING FROM THE OTHERS, WENT BEHIND THE
VIOLINS PLAYED VERY SHRILLY AND MERRILY AND ONE OF THE WOMEN WITH THICK

NATASHA ROSE AND CURTSIED TO THE SPLENDID COUNTESS. SHE WAS SO PLEASED

"DO MAKE ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARMING DAUGHTERS," SAID SHE. "THE

DURING THIS ACT EVERY TIME NATASHA LOOKED TOWARD THE STALLS SHE SAW

INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUTS OF THE AUDIENCE.
EVERYONE KNELT DOWN AND SANG A PRAYER. ALL THESE THINGS WERE REPEATEDLY
BEHIND THE SCENES SOMETHING METALLIC WAS STRUCK THREE TIMES AND
BUT SANG WITH HER FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN AT LAST DRAGGED HER OFF, AND
IN WHITE AND WAS NOW IN LIGHT BLUE. THEY DID NOT DRAG HER AWAY AT ONCE,
SOME OTHER PEOPLE RAN IN AND BEGAN DRAGGING AWAY THE MAIDEN WHO HAD BEEN
THINGS LIKE DAGGERS IN THEIR HANDS. THEY BEGAN WAVING THEIR ARMS. THEN
PEOPLE APPEARED FROM RIGHT AND LEFT WEARING BLACK CLOAKS AND HOLDING

CARESSING LOOK THAT IT SEEMED STRANGE TO BE SO NEAR HIM, TO LOOK AT HIM
ALMOST SMILING, HE GAZED STRAIGHT INTO HER EYES WITH SUCH AN ENRAPTURED
SOMETHING TOLD HER IT WAS KURAGIN. SHE TURNED AND THEIR EYES MET.
WITH PIERRE, NATASHA HEARD A MAN'S VOICE IN COUNTESS BEZUKHOVA'S BOX AND
ELBOWS AND, SMILING, TALKED TO HER FOR A LONG TIME. WHILE CONVERSING
THE ROWS, CAME TOWARD THEIR BOX. WHEN HE GOT THERE HE LEANED ON HIS
BOX. ON SEEING NATASHA PIERRE GREW ANIMATED AND, HASTILY PASSING BETWEEN

WAS TALKING ABOUT HER AND THIS AFFORDED HER PLEASURE. SHE EVEN TURNED SO
OF THE ORCHESTRA PARTITION, LOOKING AT THE ROSTOVS' BOX. NATASHA KNEW HE
DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT ENTR'ACTE KURAGIN STOOD WITH DOLOKHOV IN FRONT

IN THEIR WISH TO LET EVERYONE SEE THAT THEY KNEW HER.
DISTINGUISHED AND INTELLECTUAL MEN, WHO SEEMED TO VIE WITH ONE ANOTHER

THE SCANTILY CLAD HELENE SMILED AT EVERYONE IN THE SAME WAY, AND NATASHA

EVERYTHING SEEMED SIMPLE AND NATURAL.
HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN LOVE. IN THE STATE OF INTOXICATION SHE WAS IN,
CONGRATULATED ON HIS APPROACHING WEDDING THAT SAME BORIS WITH WHOM SHE
WENT AWAY. NATASHA WITH A GAY, COQUETTISH SMILE TALKED TO HIM, AND
TO NATASHA AND SONYA HIS FIANCEE'S INVITATION TO HER WEDDING, AND
SIMPLY, AND RAISING HIS EYEBROWS WITH AN ABSENT-MINDED SMILE CONVEYED

DELIBERATELY DOWN THE CARPETED GANGWAY, HIS SWORD AND SPURS SLIGHTLY

AND HAD HIS HANDSOME FACE NOT WORN SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF GOOD-HUMORED
SWAGGER WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDICULOUS HAD HE NOT BEEN SO GOOD-LOOKING
UNIFORM WITH ONE EPAULET AND A SHOULDER KNOT. HE MOVED WITH A RESTRAINED
NOTICED LONG AGO AT THE BALL IN PETERSBURG. HE WAS NOW IN AN ADJUTANT'S
COURTEOUS BEARING. THIS WAS ANATOLE KURAGIN WHOM SHE HAD SEEN AND
HANDSOME ADJUTANT APPROACHING THEIR BOX WITH A SELF-ASSURED YET
NATASHA, FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF THAT LOOK, SAW AN EXCEPTIONALLY

ON THE STAGE, AND EXPRESSED DELIGHT WHICH TO NATASHA SEEMED FEIGNED. "I

WENT UP TO HER AND BEGAN SINGING, WAVING HIS ARMS ABOUT.

ATTRACTING EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, YET AS MUCH AT EASE AS THOUGH HE WERE

THE BEST MATCHES IN RUSSIA.

HER BARE ARMS AND NECK--SUDDENLY AFFECTED HER BOTH AGREEABLY AND
EXPERIENCED FOR A LONG TIME--THAT OF HUNDREDS OF EYES LOOKING AT
SCANNING THE BRILLIANT TIERS OF BOXES OPPOSITE. A SENSATION SHE HAD NOT
PLAYED. NATASHA, SMOOTHING HER GOWN, WENT IN WITH SONYA AND SAT DOWN,
AT NATASHA. THE CURTAIN HAD NOT YET RISEN AND THE OVERTURE WAS BEING
THEIR EYES. A LADY ENTERING THE NEXT BOX SHOT A GLANCE OF FEMININE ENVY
SHOULDERS, AND NOISY STALLS BRILLIANT WITH UNIFORMS, GLITTERED BEFORE
DOOR ROWS OF BRIGHTLY LIT BOXES IN WHICH LADIES SAT WITH BARE ARMS AND
OPENED THE DOOR OF THEIR BOX. THE MUSIC SOUNDED LOUDER AND THROUGH THE
AN ATTENDANT DEFERENTIALLY AND QUICKLY SLIPPED BEFORE THE LADIES AND

"NATASHA, YOUR HAIR!..." WHISPERED SONYA.

THROUGH THE CLOSED DOORS THE MUSIC WAS ALREADY AUDIBLE.
THEY ALL THREE WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO THE FIRST ROW OF BOXES.
PASSING AMONG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE ENTERING AND THE PROGRAM SELLERS,
JUMPED OUT QUICKLY. THE COUNT GOT OUT HELPED BY THE FOOTMEN, AND,
SQUEAKING OVER THE SNOW. NATASHA AND SONYA, HOLDING UP THEIR DRESSES,
CARRIAGES, THE ROSTOVS' CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO THE THEATER, ITS WHEELS
WHERE SHE WAS GOING AND WITH WHOM. HAVING FALLEN INTO THE LINE OF
THE FROZEN WINDOW, SHE FELT STILL SADDER AND MORE IN LOVE, AND FORGOT
FATHER, PENSIVELY WATCHING THE LIGHTS OF THE STREET LAMPS FLICKERING ON
LOVE SUCH AS FILLED HER HEART. WHILE SHE SAT IN THE CARRIAGE BESIDE HER
ONCE, TO EMBRACE THE MAN SHE LOVED, TO SPEAK AND HEAR FROM HIM WORDS OF
ENOUGH FOR HER TO LOVE AND KNOW SHE WAS BELOVED, SHE WANTED NOW, AT
NATASHA AT THAT MOMENT FELT SO SOFTENED AND TENDER THAT IT WAS NOT

"NO, SHE'S ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT. I CAN'T!"
LOOKING AT SONYA, WHO ALSO CAME IN QUITE READY, WITH A FAN IN HER HAND.
SO CALMLY AND QUIETLY AND WAIT SO LONG AND SO PATIENTLY?" THOUGHT SHE,
GLASS, MAKING AN EFFORT NOT TO CRY. "AND HOW CAN SONYA LOVE NICHOLAS
THIS WAITING AND I SHALL CRY IN A MINUTE!" AND SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THE
OF HIM BUT FORGET HIM, QUITE FORGET HIM FOR THE PRESENT. I CAN'T BEAR
MANLY AND YET CHILDLIKE.... NO, I HAD BETTER NOT THINK OF HIM; NOT THINK
LOVE HIM ALONE, HIM, HIM, WITH THAT FACE AND THOSE EYES, WITH HIS SMILE,
THOUGHT NATASHA. "AND WHAT DO HIS FATHER AND SISTER MATTER TO ME? I
MAKE HIM LAUGH AS HE USED TO LAUGH. AND HIS EYES--HOW I SEE THOSE EYES!"
INQUIRING EYES WITH WHICH HE HAS SO OFTEN LOOKED AT ME, AND THEN I WOULD
EMBRACE HIM, CLING TO HIM, AND MAKE HIM LOOK AT ME WITH THOSE SEARCHING
DIFFERENTLY. I WOULD NOT BE SILLY AND AFRAID OF THINGS, I WOULD SIMPLY
"O GOD, IF HE WERE HERE NOW I WOULD NOT BEHAVE AS I DID THEN, BUT

IT WAS A SWEET, TENDER SADNESS.
THERE SAW THAT SHE WAS PRETTY, VERY PRETTY, SHE FELT EVEN MORE SAD, BUT
INTO THE BALLROOM TO AWAIT HER FATHER, AND LOOKING IN THE LARGE MIRROR

NATASHA DID NOT WANT TO GO, BUT COULD NOT REFUSE MARYA DMITRIEVNA'S KIND

NATASHA WAS AND JESTED RESOLUTELY AND LOUDLY AT TABLE WITH THE COUNT AND
THE PRINCE HAD RECEIVED THE ROSTOVS, PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE HOW UPSET

"I CAN'T TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW. NO ONE'S TO BLAME," SAID NATASHA--"IT'S

WET FACE AGAINST HER.
NATASHA RAISED HER HEAD AND, KISSING HER FRIEND ON THE LIPS, PRESSED HER

MIND? KISS ME," SAID SONYA.
"DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, NATASHA. IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT SO WHY SHOULD YOU

"NATASHA, WHAT IS IT ABOUT?" SHE ASKED. "WHAT DO THEY MATTER TO YOU? IT

STOOD BESIDE HER, KISSING HER HAIR.
IN HER ROOM CRYING LIKE A CHILD, BLOWING HER NOSE AND SOBBING. SONYA
THEY WAITED A LONG TIME FOR NATASHA TO COME TO DINNER THAT DAY. SHE SAT

OUT OF THE ROOM.
"WHAT HAVE I SAID AND WHAT HAVE I DONE?" THOUGHT SHE, AS SOON AS SHE WAS

HER.
WITH EXTERNAL DIGNITY AND COLDNESS, THOUGH SHE FELT THE TEARS CHOKING
"I THINK, PRINCESS, IT IS NOT CONVENIENT TO SPEAK OF THAT NOW," SHE SAID

THIS AND GUESSED ITS REASON.
SHE PAUSED, FEELING THAT SHE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. NATASHA NOTICED

"DEAR NATALIE," SAID PRINCESS MARY, "I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM GLAD

NATASHA GLANCED AT HER IRONICALLY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY.

THE USE OF THE INCOME FROM THEM. JULIE SAW BORIS' INDECISION, AND
THE POSSESSOR OF THOSE PENZA AND NIZHEGOROD ESTATES AND HAD APPORTIONED

THEN BACK AGAIN, RE-ENTERING, HE BY THE FRONT AND SHE BY THE BACK PORCH.
"SONYA!... NICHOLAS!"... WAS ALL THEY SAID. THEY RAN TO THE BARN AND

THEM TO HIS CHEEKS.
KISSED HIM FULL ON THE LIPS, AND DISENGAGING HER LITTLE HANDS PRESSED
ON THE LIPS THAT WORE A MUSTACHE AND HAD A SMELL OF BURNT CORK. SONYA
THAT COVERED HER HEAD, EMBRACED HER, PRESSED HER TO HIM, AND KISSED HER
FACE ALL LIT UP BY THE MOONLIGHT. HE SLIPPED HIS ARMS UNDER THE CLOAK

TOUSLED HAIR AND A HAPPY SMILE NEW TO SONYA. SHE RAN RAPIDLY TOWARD HIM.

NICHOLAS CAME THE CRUNCHING, WHISTLING SOUND OF SONYA'S FEET IN HER THIN
"I AM NOT AFRAID," ANSWERED SONYA'S VOICE, AND ALONG THE PATH TOWARD

THE VOICE OF AN OLD MAIDSERVANT SAYING, "STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT, ALONG THE

FROM THE BACK PORCH CAME THE SOUND OF FEET DESCENDING THE STEPS, THE

SEEMED TO INHALE NOT AIR BUT THE STRENGTH OF ETERNAL YOUTH AND GLADNESS.
WITH THE FROST, AND THEN ALL WAS AGAIN PERFECTLY SILENT. HIS BOSOM

THAT WAY. HALFWAY LAY SOME SNOW-COVERED PILES OF FIREWOOD AND ACROSS AND
ALONG THE PATH THAT LED TO THE BACK PORCH. HE KNEW SONYA WOULD PASS
AND RUNNING OUT FROM THE PORCH HE WENT ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND
"I AM A FOOL, A FOOL! WHAT HAVE I BEEN WAITING FOR?" THOUGHT NICHOLAS,

GAY.
STARS WERE UNNOTICED. THE SKY WAS BLACK AND DREARY, WHILE THE EARTH WAS
SO MANY STARS THAT ONE DID NOT WISH TO LOOK UP AT THE SKY AND THE REAL
BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE. THE LIGHT WAS SO STRONG AND THE SNOW SPARKLED WITH
OUTSIDE, THERE WAS THE SAME COLD STILLNESS AND THE SAME MOON, BUT EVEN

HAD MADE THE HOUSE STUFFY.
TO THE FRONT PORCH, SAYING HE FELT TOO HOT. THE CROWD OF PEOPLE REALLY
SONYA WENT OUT INTO THE PASSAGE TO GO TO THE BARN. NICHOLAS WENT HASTILY

THINKING OF TILL NOW?"
"WHAT A DARLING THAT GIRL IS!" THOUGHT HE. "AND WHAT HAVE I BEEN

SHOULDERS AND GLANCED AT NICHOLAS.
AND THEY HANDED HER A FUR CLOAK. SHE THREW THIS OVER HER HEAD AND
THEY TOLD HER WHERE THE BARN WAS AND HOW SHE SHOULD STAND AND LISTEN,

UP.
"I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING," SAID SONYA. "MAY I GO AT ONCE?" SHE GOT

DIMPLED HER CHEEKS, A SMILE HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
AT HER SPARKLING EYES, AND UNDER THE MUSTACHE A HAPPY RAPTUROUS SMILE
"SO THAT'S WHAT SHE IS LIKE; WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN!" HE THOUGHT GAZING

THAN NICHOLAS HAD EVER SEEN HER BEFORE.
REALLY, THAT EVENING, SONYA WAS BRIGHTER, MORE ANIMATED, AND PRETTIER
TO THAT BURNT-CORK MUSTACHE, THAT HE HAD FULLY LEARNED TO KNOW HER. AND
WITH QUITE NEW EYES. IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS ONLY TODAY, THANKS
TALKING AS NOW, NICHOLAS DID NOT LEAVE SONYA'S SIDE, AND GAZED AT HER
WHETHER THEY WERE PLAYING THE RING AND STRING GAME OR THE RUBLE GAME OR

"LOUISA IVANOVNA, MAY I?" ASKED SONYA.

"WELL, WHY NOT, IF YOU'RE NOT AFRAID?"

"YES, I WILL; PELAGEYA DANILOVNA, LET ME! I'LL GO," SAID SONYA.

"OH, I'VE FORGOTTEN..." SHE REPLIED. "BUT NONE OF YOU WOULD GO?"

PELAGEYA DANILOVNA SMILED.

"MAMMA, TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN THE BARN."

GRAIN IS GOOD AND ONE SOMETIMES HEARS THAT, TOO."
YOU HEAR; HAMMERING AND KNOCKING--THAT'S BAD; BUT A SOUND OF SHIFTING
"WELL, SAY YOU WENT TO THE BARN NOW, AND LISTENED. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT

"AND HOW DOES ONE DO IT IN A BARN?" INQUIRED SONYA.

"MAMMA, YOU USED TO TRY YOUR FATE YOURSELF..." SAID HER DAUGHTER.

"NOW, WHY FRIGHTEN THEM?" SAID PELAGEYA DANILOVNA.

"TELL WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG LADY!" SAID THE SECOND MELYUKOV GIRL.

"I'LL GO," SAID SONYA.

"YOU WOULDN'T GO, IT TAKES COURAGE..."

"WHY?" SAID THE ELDEST MELYUKOV GIRL.

NICHOLAS GAVE THE HORSES THE REIN, AND ZAKHAR, STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS,

COMING OUT UPON A BROAD TRODDEN TRACK ACROSS A MEADOW, NEAR A RIVER.
NICHOLAS OVERTOOK THE FIRST SLEIGH. THEY WERE DRIVING DOWNHILL AND

READY TO PUT ON SPEED WHEN REQUIRED.
BENEATH THE BOW OVER ITS HEAD, WITH NO THOUGHT OF SLACKENING PACE AND
TO GALLOP--THE OTHER SLEIGHS FOLLOWED. THE SHAFT HORSE SWUNG STEADILY
SCREAMS SQUEALS, AND WAVING OF WHIPS THAT CAUSED EVEN THE SHAFT HORSES

SIDE HORSES WHO PULLED HARDER--EVER INCREASING THEIR GALLOP--THAT ONE
IT WAS ONLY BY THE KEENER WIND THAT MET THEM AND THE JERKS GIVEN BY THE

"THAT USED TO BE SONYA," THOUGHT HE, AND LOOKED AT HER CLOSER AND

HIM FROM HER SABLE FURS--SO CLOSE AND YET SO DISTANT--IN THE MOONLIGHT.
QUITE A NEW, SWEET FACE WITH BLACK EYEBROWS AND MUSTACHES PEEPED UP AT
NICHOLAS GLANCED ROUND AT SONYA, AND BENT DOWN TO SEE HER FACE CLOSER.

THE BOOKCASE WITH HER EYES FIXED ON A STREAK OF LIGHT ESCAPING FROM THE
A WHOLE SERIES OF REMINISCENCES AROSE FROM THOSE SOUNDS. SHE SAT BEHIND

READILY AS THEY DID HERS. "WHAT CAN I DO, WHERE CAN I GO?" THOUGHT SHE,
GET ANGRY OR SULKY WITH HER; BUT THE SERFS FULFILLED NO ONE'S ORDERS SO
THEM ON SOME ERRAND. SHE SEEMED TO BE TRYING WHETHER ANY OF THEM WOULD

"SIT DOWN WITH ME A LITTLE," SAID THE COUNTESS.

"DON'T LOOK AT ME, MAMMA! DON'T LOOK; I SHALL CRY DIRECTLY."

THE COUNTESS LIFTED HER HEAD AND LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT HER DAUGHTER.

GLITTERING EYES AND NO SIGN OF A SMILE.

SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE AS HAPPY AND TRANQUIL AS I AM NOW."
RINGING LAUGHTER. "AND DO YOU KNOW," SHE SUDDENLY SAID, "I KNOW THAT I
CARRIED HERSELF, HOW WELL!'" AND NICHOLAS HEARD HER SPONTANEOUS, HAPPY,

THEY WERE FOND OF ASKING ONE ANOTHER THAT QUESTION.

"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT JUST NOW, NICHOLAS?" INQUIRED NATASHA.

"GOT IT?" SAID NICHOLAS.

OF WHICH SHE HAD ALL THE WAY BEEN TRYING TO GET AND HAD AT LAST CAUGHT.
SUDDENLY STRUCK UP THE AIR OF AS 'TWAS GROWING DARK LAST NIGHT--THE TUNE

"YES," RETURNED NICHOLAS. "YOU'RE NOT COLD?"

"WHAT A DARLING UNCLE IS!" SAID NATASHA, WHEN THEY HAD COME OUT ONTO THE

CHEERFUL SMELL OF SMOKE.
IN THE VILLAGE THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED THERE WERE RED LIGHTS AND A

GROWING DARK LAST NIGHT.
VOICE NATASHA HAD KNOWN PREVIOUSLY, BUT THE ONE THAT HAD SUNG AS 'TWAS
"GOOD-BY, DEAR NIECE," HIS VOICE CALLED OUT OF THE DARKNESS--NOT THE

IN FRONT WITH LANTERNS.
SO THAT THEY HAD TO GO ROUND BY THE FORD, AND HE SENT HUNTSMEN TO RIDE
ACCOMPANIED THEM ON FOOT AS FAR AS THE BRIDGE THAT COULD NOT BE CROSSED,
NATASHA UP WARMLY AND TOOK LEAVE OF HER WITH QUITE A NEW TENDERNESS. HE
TRAPS. NATASHA AND NICHOLAS GOT INTO THE OTHER. "UNCLE" WRAPPED
PETYA WAS CARRIED OUT LIKE A LOG AND LAID IN THE LARGER OF THE TWO

COUNTESS DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND WERE VERY ANXIOUS, SAID ONE OF
TO LOOK FOR THEM, ARRIVED TO FETCH NATASHA AND PETYA. THE COUNT AND
AFTER NINE O'CLOCK TWO TRAPS AND THREE MOUNTED MEN, WHO HAD BEEN SENT

AT ONCE FOUND THE CHORDS OF THE SONG.
HARP AND TO PLAY ONLY THE GUITAR. SHE ASKED "UNCLE" FOR HIS GUITAR AND
ECSTASIES OVER "UNCLE'S" SINGING. SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE UP LEARNING THE
TUNE, LIKE THE SONG OF A BIRD, WAS EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD. NATASHA WAS IN
ONLY TO GIVE MEASURE TO THE WORDS. AS A RESULT OF THIS THE UNCONSIDERED
ITSELF, AND THAT APART FROM THE WORDS THERE IS NO TUNE, WHICH EXISTS
WHOLE MEANING OF A SONG LIES IN THE WORDS AND THAT THE TUNE COMES OF

SUDDENLY BECAME SERIOUS. BUT THIS LASTED ONLY A SECOND. "DON'T DARE
HE WOULD UNDERSTAND IT ALL. WHERE IS HE NOW?" SHE THOUGHT, AND HER FACE
THOUGHT MY BOLKONSKI WOULD NOT APPROVE OF OR UNDERSTAND OUR GAIETY. BUT
WHEN HE SAID 'CHOSEN ALREADY'? IS HE GLAD OF IT OR NOT? IT IS AS IF HE
OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AROSE IN HER. "WHAT DID NICHOLAS' SMILE MEAN
"AND SUCH A ONE!" SHE SAID. BUT AS SOON AS SHE HAD SAID IT A NEW TRAIN

NODDED HER HEAD WITH A HAPPY SMILE.
"OH?" SAID "UNCLE" IN SURPRISE, LOOKING INQUIRINGLY AT NATASHA, WHO

"HE'S CHOSEN ALREADY," SAID NICHOLAS SMILING.

END, AND THEY WERE ALREADY ADMIRING HER.
NICHOLAS AND THE OTHERS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT DO THE RIGHT THING WAS AT AN
PROUDLY, AND WITH SLY MERRIMENT, THE FEAR THAT HAD AT FIRST SEIZED
OF HER. AS SOON AS SHE HAD STRUCK HER POSE, AND SMILED TRIUMPHANTLY,
THOSE INIMITABLE AND UNTEACHABLE RUSSIAN ONES THAT "UNCLE" HAD EXPECTED
SUPPOSED, LONG AGO HAVE EFFACED? BUT THE SPIRIT AND THE MOVEMENTS WERE
AND OBTAINED THAT MANNER WHICH THE PAS DE CHALE * WOULD, ONE WOULD HAVE
FRENCH GOVERNESS, IMBIBED FROM THE RUSSIAN AIR SHE BREATHED THAT SPIRIT
WHERE, HOW, AND WHEN HAD THIS YOUNG COUNTESS, EDUCATED BY AN EMIGREE

"UNCLE," AND SETTING HER ARMS AKIMBO ALSO MADE A MOTION WITH HER
NATASHA THREW OFF THE SHAWL FROM HER SHOULDERS, RAN FORWARD TO FACE

JUST STRUCK A CHORD.
"NOW THEN, NIECE!" HE EXCLAIMED, WAVING TO NATASHA THE HAND THAT HAD

NAIVE AND PRECISE ATTITUDE PREPARATORY TO A FOLK DANCE.
SMILED SERIOUSLY AT THE MERRY FELLOW, WHILE THE MERRY FELLOW STRUCK A
"UNCLE" ROSE, AND IT WAS AS IF THERE WERE TWO MEN IN HIM: ONE OF THEM

DEPENDED ON IT.
"GO ON, UNCLE DEAR," NATASHA WAILED IN AN IMPLORING TONE AS IF HER LIFE

STRINGS, AND THEN HE STOPPED SHORT AND JERKED HIS SHOULDERS.
PLAYED "UNCLE" ONCE MORE, RUNNING HIS FINGERS SKILLFULLY OVER THE

    FETCHING WATER CLEAR AND SWEET,

IN THE DOORWAY AND BEHIND HERS OTHER FACES...
PLAYED THE PIECE OVER AGAIN. ANISYA FEDOROVNA'S SMILING FACE REAPPEARED
NICHOLAS TOO WAS GREATLY PLEASED BY "UNCLE'S" PLAYING, AND "UNCLE"

SO?"
SHE SAID, TURNING TO HER BROTHER, AS IF ASKING HIM: "WHAT IS IT MOVES ME
FINISHED. SHE JUMPED UP AND HUGGED AND KISSED HIM. "NICHOLAS, NICHOLAS!"
"LOVELY, LOVELY! GO ON, UNCLE, GO ON!" SHOUTED NATASHA AS SOON AS HE HAD

HE RAN HIS FINGERS OVER THE STRINGS, SOMETHING SEEMED TO SNAP.
THE SONG GREW BRISKER AND THE TIME QUICKER AND WHEN, HERE AND THERE, AS
A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE UNDER HIS GRAY MUSTACHES, ESPECIALLY AS
WHERE ANISYA FEDOROVNA HAD JUST STOOD. SOMETHING SEEMED TO BE LAUGHING
FIRMNESS, LOOKING WITH A CHANGED AND INSPIRED EXPRESSION AT THE SPOT
THE ROOM. "UNCLE" CONTINUED TO PLAY CORRECTLY, CAREFULLY, WITH ENERGETIC
FLUSHED, AND DRAWING HER KERCHIEF OVER HER FACE WENT LAUGHING OUT OF
MIRTH AS RADIATED FROM ANISYA FEDOROVNA'S WHOLE BEING. ANISYA FEDOROVNA
HEARTS OF NICHOLAS AND NATASHA, AROUSING IN THEM THE SAME KIND OF SOBER
TUNE, PLAYED WITH PRECISION AND IN EXACT TIME, BEGAN TO THRILL IN THE
MY LADY, BUT THE WELL-KNOWN SONG: CAME A MAIDEN DOWN THE STREET. THE
QUIETLY, SMOOTHLY, AND CONFIDENTLY BEGAN PLAYING IN VERY SLOW TIME, NOT
ANISYA FEDOROVNA, STRUCK A SINGLE CHORD, PURE AND SONOROUS, AND THEN
HIS LEFT ELBOW WITH A SOMEWHAT THEATRICAL GESTURE, AND, WITH A WINK AT
ARMCHAIR. HE TOOK THE GUITAR A LITTLE ABOVE THE FINGERBOARD, ARCHING
CASE WITH HIS BONY FINGERS, TUNED THE GUITAR AND SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS
WITHOUT LOOKING AT ANYONE, "UNCLE" BLEW THE DUST OFF IT AND, TAPPING THE

ERRAND AND BROUGHT BACK THE GUITAR.
ANISYA FEDOROVNA, WITH HER LIGHT STEP, WILLINGLY WENT TO FULFILL HER

TOUCHED IT FOR A LONG TIME. THAT'S IT--COME ON! I'VE GIVEN IT UP."
"ANISYA, GO AND SEE IF THE STRINGS OF MY GUITAR ARE ALL RIGHT. I HAVEN'T

"DO YOU PLAY THEN?" ASKED NATASHA.

ON!--OUGHT TO BURST OUT."
ENERGETIC GESTURE. "HERE HE OUGHT TO BURST OUT--THAT'S IT, COME
"HE DOESN'T PLAY THAT PART RIGHT!" SAID "UNCLE" SUDDENLY, WITH AN

"UNCLE'S." "THAT'S A GOOD PLAYER OF OURS," SHE ADDED.
"YOU LIKE LISTENING?" SHE SAID TO NATASHA, WITH A SMILE EXTREMELY LIKE

AND LEANED HER PORTLY PERSON AGAINST THE DOORPOST.
OF IT AND WISHED TO HEAR IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. ANISYA FEDOROVNA CAME IN
THE SAME NOTES WERE THRUMMED AGAIN, BUT THE LISTENERS DID NOT GROW WEARY
REPEATED A HUNDRED TIMES. THE BALALAYKA WAS RETUNED SEVERAL TIMES AND
LISTENING, SLIGHTLY SMILING, WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE. THE AIR WAS
TO THE AIR OF MY LADY, WITH TRILLS AND VARIATIONS. "UNCLE" SAT
CEASED. MITKA TUNED UP AFRESH, AND RECOMMENCED THRUMMING THE BALALAYKA
"MORE, PLEASE, MORE!" CRIED NATASHA AT THE DOOR AS SOON AS THE BALALAYKA

TO HER THE ACME OF MUSICAL DELIGHT.
TO HER THE BEST IN THE WORLD, SO ALSO THAT SONG, AT THAT MOMENT, SEEMED
JUST AS "UNCLE'S" PICKLED MUSHROOMS, HONEY, AND CHERRY BRANDY HAD SEEMED

"NOT 'VERY GOOD' IT'S SIMPLY DELICIOUS!"

PAST AND FUTURE HUNTS, OF RUGAY AND ILAGIN'S DOGS, WHILE NATASHA SAT

REBUKE EVERYBODY, AND, WITH AN AIR OF NOT WISHING TO SPEAK TO ANYONE,
AND SMARTLY ACROSS HIS HORSE'S BACK AS IF BY THAT GESTURE HE MEANT TO
AT ANY OTHER TIME. "UNCLE" HIMSELF TWISTED UP THE HARE, THREW IT NEATLY
ASHAMED OF SO WILD A CRY AND EVERYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT IT
TALKING AT ONCE, AND IT WAS SO STRANGE THAT SHE MUST HERSELF HAVE BEEN
TINGLING. BY THAT SHRIEK SHE EXPRESSED WHAT THE OTHERS EXPRESSED BY ALL
JOYOUSLY, ECSTATICALLY, AND SO PIERCINGLY THAT IT SET EVERYONE'S EAR

ILAGIN WAS SAYING AT THE SAME TIME, BREATHLESS FROM HIS GALLOP AND HIS

IT HAS BEATEN THEM ALL, THE THOUSAND-RUBLE AS WELL AS THE ONE-RUBLE

THE DELIGHTED "UNCLE" DISMOUNTED, AND CUT OFF A PAD, SHAKING THE HARE
HIM. A MOMENT LATER EVERYONE HAD DRAWN UP ROUND THE CROWD OF DOGS. ONLY
HIS BACK, HE ROLLED OVER WITH THE HARE. A RING OF BORZOIS SURROUNDED
HIS KNEES IN THE MUDDY FIELD, AND ALL ONE COULD SEE WAS HOW, MUDDYING
ONTO THE RYEFIELD, AGAIN PUT ON SPEED STILL MORE VICIOUSLY, SINKING TO
TERRIBLE STRAIN, PUT ON SPEED CLOSE TO THE HARE, KNOCKED IT OFF THE BALK
WITH THE TWO FOREMOST BORZOIS, PUSHED AHEAD OF THEM REGARDLESS OF THE
AND "UNCLE'S" RED BORZOI, STRAINING AND CURVING ITS BACK, CAUGHT UP
"RUGAY, RUGAYUSHKA! THAT'S IT, COME ON!" CAME A THIRD VOICE JUST THEN,

QUICKLY.
FOR THE HARE TO RUN ON THE BALK AND THE BORZOIS DID NOT OVERTAKE HIM SO
OF CARRIAGE HORSES, AND BEGAN TO OVERTAKE THE HARE, BUT IT WAS EASIER
AND THE STUBBLE. AGAIN ERZA AND MILKA WERE ABREAST, RUNNING LIKE A PAIR
PREY, THE HARE MOVED AND DARTED ALONG THE BALK BETWEEN THE WINTER RYE
HEARKEN TO HIS APPEAL. AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE SEIZED HER
"ERZA, DARLING!" ILAGIN WAILED IN A VOICE UNLIKE HIS OWN. ERZA DID NOT

NOT TO MAKE A MISTAKE THIS TIME BUT SEIZE HIS HIND LEG.
WHEN CLOSE TO THE HARE'S SCUT PAUSED AS IF MEASURING THE DISTANCE, SO AS
PAST. THE HARE HAD SQUATTED. AGAIN THE BEAUTIFUL ERZA REACHED HIM, BUT
WOULD IMMEDIATELY POUNCE ON THE HARE, BUT SHE OVERTOOK HIM AND FLEW

BEFORE ILAGIN'S RED-SPOTTED ERZA PASSED THEM, GOT WITHIN A LENGTH, FLEW

AND, FINALLY HAVING CHOSEN HIS DIRECTION AND REALIZED HIS DANGER, LAID
TOOK A DOZEN BOUNDS, NOT VERY QUICKLY, LETTING THE BORZOIS GAIN ON HIM,
THE SHOUTING AND TRAMPLING THAT RESOUNDED FROM ALL SIDES AT ONCE. HE
HE JUMPED UP HE DID NOT RUN AT ONCE, BUT PRICKED HIS EARS LISTENING TO
OF THE CHASE. THE HARE THEY HAD STARTED WAS A STRONG AND SWIFT ONE. WHEN
BORZOIS AND THE HARE AND FEARING ONLY TO LOSE SIGHT EVEN FOR AN INSTANT
AND "UNCLE" FLEW, RECKLESS OF WHERE AND HOW THEY WENT, SEEING ONLY THE
SETTING THE BORZOIS ON THE HARE. THE TRANQUIL ILAGIN, NICHOLAS, NATASHA,
WHILE THE BORZOI WHIPS, WITH A CRY OF "A-TU!" GALLOPED ACROSS THE FIELD
WHO HAD BEEN MOVING SLOWLY, SHOUTED, "STOP!" CALLING IN THE HOUNDS,
WERE NOT ON LEASH DARTED AFTER THE HOUNDS AND THE HARE. ALL THE HUNT,
DOWNHILL IN FULL CRY AFTER THE HARE, AND FROM ALL SIDES THE BORZOIS THAT
NEXT MORNING, WAS UNABLE TO REST AND LEAPED UP. THE PACK ON LEASH RUSHED
BUT BEFORE THE WHIP COULD REPLY, THE HARE, SCENTING THE FROST COMING

WHIP WHO HAD SIGHTED THE HARE.
"HOW IS IT POINTING?" ASKED NICHOLAS, RIDING A HUNDRED PACES TOWARD THE

GENTLEFOLK, ALSO MOVED AWAY. ALL WERE MOVING SLOWLY AND SEDATELY.
ON THE HORIZON TURNED AWAY FROM THE HARE, AND THE WHIPS, BUT NOT THE
GENTLEFOLK RODE UP TO HIM AT A FOOTPACE; THE HOUNDS THAT WERE FAR OFF

"A FULL-GROWN ONE?" ASKED ILAGIN AS HE APPROACHED THE WHIP WHO HAD

PITTING AGAINST HIS OWN BORZOIS. "AND SUPPOSE THEY OUTDO MY MILKA AT
AND "UNCLE'S" RED RUGAY TWO RIVALS HE HAD NEVER YET HAD A CHANCE OF

"AH, HE HAS FOUND ONE, I THINK," SAID ILAGIN CARELESSLY. "YES, WE MUST

AND AGAIN REPEATED HIS LONG-DRAWN CRY, "A-TU!" (THIS CALL AND THE

FULL-GROWN HARE WOULD CROSS THE FIELD NOW I'D SHOW YOU WHAT SORT OF
"YES, SHE'S FAST ENOUGH," REPLIED NICHOLAS, AND THOUGHT: "IF ONLY A

BLACK-SPOTTED ONE OF YOURS IS FINE--WELL SHAPED!" SAID HE.
AND PICKED OUT MILKA WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION BY HER BREADTH. "THAT
TO RETURN THE YOUNG COUNT'S COMPLIMENT, ILAGIN LOOKED AT HIS BORZOIS
CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION THEY HAD BEGUN. AND CONSIDERING IT POLITE
YOUR PARTS, TOO, THE HARVEST IS NOTHING TO BOAST OF, COUNT?" HE WENT ON,
BEFORE, HE HAD GIVEN A NEIGHBOR THREE FAMILIES OF HOUSE SERFS. "SO IN

"A FINE LITTLE BITCH, THAT!" SAID HE IN A CARELESS TONE. "IS SHE SWIFT?"

IN THE MIDDLE OF A SOBER CONVERSATION BEGUN BY ILAGIN ABOUT THE YEAR'S

SWIFTNESS OF ILAGIN'S BORZOIS, AND IN THAT BEAUTIFUL BITCH SAW A RIVAL
STEEL, A DELICATE MUZZLE, AND PROMINENT BLACK EYES. HE HAD HEARD OF THE
RED-SPOTTED BITCH ON ILAGIN'S LEASH, SLENDER BUT WITH MUSCLES LIKE

PUNISHED WHO HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO SEIZE A FOX HUNTED BY SOMEONE ELSE'S
CAP AND SAID HE MUCH REGRETTED WHAT HAD OCCURRED AND WOULD HAVE THE MAN

GENTLEMAN WHO WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE YOUNG COUNT'S
INSTEAD OF AN ENEMY, NICHOLAS FOUND IN ILAGIN A STATELY AND COURTEOUS

ACCOMPANIED BY TWO HUNT SERVANTS.

HARDLY HAD HE PASSED AN ANGLE OF THE WOOD BEFORE A STOUT GENTLEMAN IN

PREPARED TO TAKE THE MOST RESOLUTE AND DESPERATE STEPS TO PUNISH HIS

THE FACTS WERE THAT ILAGIN, WITH WHOM THE ROSTOVS HAD A QUARREL AND WERE

SURROUNDED BY INQUIRING SYMPATHIZERS, RECOUNTED HIS EXPLOITS.
THE VICTORIOUS HUNTSMAN RODE OFF TO JOIN THE FIELD, AND THERE,

NICHOLAS SENT THE MAN TO CALL NATASHA AND PETYA TO HIM, AND RODE AT A

FOR SOLE REPLY DANIEL GAVE HIM A SHY, CHILDLIKE, MEEK, AND AMIABLE

THE COUNT REMEMBERED THE WOLF HE HAD LET SLIP AND HIS ENCOUNTER WITH

BROAD-BROWED HEAD HANGING DOWN AND THE BITTEN STICK BETWEEN HER JAWS,
AND THEIR STORIES, AND ALL CAME TO LOOK AT THE WOLF, WHICH, WITH HER
THE CUBS AND THE BORZOIS THREE. THE HUNTSMEN ASSEMBLED WITH THEIR BOOTY
TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE ALL TO MEET. THE HOUNDS HAD KILLED TWO OF
AND SNORTING HORSE AND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOGS YELPING AT HER, TOOK HER
WITH HAPPY, EXHAUSTED FACES, THEY LAID THE OLD WOLF, ALIVE, ON A SHYING

TOGETHER, AND DANIEL ROLLED HER OVER ONCE OR TWICE FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
AND SHE WAS FASTENED WITH A LEASH, AS IF BRIDLED, HER LEGS WERE BOUND

DANIEL WHISPERED, "DON'T! WE'LL GAG HER!" AND, CHANGING HIS POSITION,

A STEP, AND WITH HIS WHOLE WEIGHT, AS IF LYING DOWN TO REST, FELL ON
TRIED TO RISE, BUT THE BORZOIS STUCK TO HER. DANIEL ROSE A LITTLE, TOOK
THAT ALL WAS NOW OVER. THE TERRIFIED WOLF PRESSED BACK HER EARS AND

DANIEL GALLOPED UP SILENTLY, HOLDING A NAKED DAGGER IN HIS LEFT HAND AND

STOPPED A SECOND TIME BY "UNCLE'S" BORZOIS.

TOWARD THE WOOD, JUST AS KARAY HAD RUN TO CUT THE ANIMAL OFF. AS A

HIS HORSE, SUPPOSING THE AFFAIR TO BE OVER. BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT THE

THE BORZOIS, WHO DID NOT GET ANY CLOSER TO HER.

LIFE SUDDENLY CAME TO PRINCESS MARY WITH SUCH FORCE THAT SHE RESOLVED TO
HER LIFE, THE THOUGHT THAT THEODOSIA ALONE HAD FOUND THE TRUE PATH OF
A ROOM WITH A LAMP DIMLY LIT BEFORE THE ICON THEODOSIA WAS TALKING OF
HEAVY CHAINS. PRINCESS MARY WAS PARTICULARLY FOND OF HER. ONCE, WHEN IN

MY DEAR FRIEND. MAY GOD KEEP YOU IN HIS HOLY AND MIGHTY CARE. MY DEAR
RUNNING ON TOO LONG AND AM AT THE END OF MY SECOND SHEET. GOOD-BY,
HE WOULD CHOOSE HER FOR A WIFE, AND FRANKLY I DO NOT WISH IT. BUT I AM
IS NOT THE KIND OF GIRL WHO COULD PLEASE PRINCE ANDREW. I DO NOT THINK
LITTLE ANGEL A STEPMOTHER. SECONDLY BECAUSE, AS FAR AS I KNOW, THAT GIRL
DEEP IN HIS HEART FOR HIM EVER TO DECIDE TO GIVE HER A SUCCESSOR AND OUR
SPEAKS ABOUT THE WIFE HE HAS LOST, THE GRIEF OF THAT LOSS HAS GONE TOO
CERTAINLY NOT HER; AND THIS IS WHY: FIRST, I KNOW THAT THOUGH HE RARELY
THE LITTLE ROSTOVA. I DO NOT THINK MY BROTHER WILL EVER MARRY AGAIN, AND
THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT--I MEAN THE REPORT OF MY BROTHER'S BETROTHAL TO
WAY RUMORS FLY FROM PETERSBURG TO MOSCOW, ESPECIALLY SUCH FALSE ONES AS
ARRIVAL IN PETERSBURG HE RECEIVED ONLY HIS DUE. I ALWAYS WONDER AT THE

RELATION, BUT I NEVER DOUBTED IT. THE GOOD HE HAS DONE TO EVERYBODY
CULTIVATED, AND CAPABLE OF THE YOUNG MEN. FORGIVE MY VANITY AS A
WRITE THAT IN PETERSBURG HE IS SPOKEN OF AS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE,
WHICH THE DOCTORS RECOMMENDED LONG AGO. I HOPE IT WILL CURE HIM. YOU
NERVOUS. I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM AND GLAD HE IS TAKING THIS TRIP ABROAD
HE HAS GROWN PHYSICALLY MUCH WEAKER. HE HAS BECOME THINNER AND MORE
THAT LIFE IS NOT OVER FOR HIM. BUT TOGETHER WITH THIS MENTAL CHANGE
HEART OF GOLD TO WHICH I KNOW NO EQUAL. HE HAS REALIZED, IT SEEMS TO ME,
BECOME AS I USED TO KNOW HIM WHEN A CHILD: KIND, AFFECTIONATE, WITH THAT
HIS SORROW HE ONLY THIS YEAR QUITE RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS. HE HAS AGAIN
ABSENCE. HE, AS I WROTE YOU BEFORE, HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH OF LATE. AFTER
OUR FAMILY LIFE GOES ON IN THE OLD WAY EXCEPT FOR MY BROTHER ANDREW'S

DISPUTES ABOUT BUONAPARTE WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE. IN ANY CASE IT WILL
DERIVE FROM A COURSE OF TREATMENT HE WOULD LOSE AS A RESULT OF THE
OF EXPRESSING HIS VIEWS REGARDLESS OF ANYBODY. ALL THE BENEFIT HE MIGHT

POLITICAL VIEWS THAT MY FATHER IS RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OF GOING TO
CANNOT STAND THIS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF HIS
ACCEPTED AS A GREAT MAN, STILL LESS AS EMPEROR OF FRANCE. AND MY FATHER
BUONAPARTE, WHO ONLY AT BALD HILLS IN THE WHOLE WORLD, IT SEEMS, IS NOT
THAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE HONORS CONFERRED ON
FROM MY FATHER'S REMARKS AND HIS TALKS WITH MICHAEL IVANOVICH I KNOW ALL
GREAT CATHERINE! AS YOU KNOW, I AM QUITE INDIFFERENT TO POLITICS, BUT
SOVEREIGNS OF EUROPE AND PARTICULARLY WITH OUR OWN, THE GRANDSON OF THE
THE NOTION THAT BUONAPARTE IS NEGOTIATING ON EQUAL TERMS WITH ALL THE
YOU KNOW, CHIEFLY DIRECTED TO POLITICAL QUESTIONS. HE CANNOT ENDURE
ANY CONTRADICTION AND IS BECOMING IRRITABLE. THIS IRRITABILITY IS, AS
IS THIS: MY FATHER'S HEALTH IS GROWING NOTICEABLY WORSE, HE CANNOT STAND
BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THE REASON FOR THIS IS BUONAPARTE! THE CASE
WISH TO SEE YOU, I DO NOT THINK SO AND DO NOT WANT TO DO SO. YOU WILL
YOU ASK WHETHER WE SHALL SPEND NEXT WINTER IN MOSCOW. IN SPITE OF MY

OUR GOOD.
GOVERNED ONLY BY INFINITE LOVE FOR US, AND SO WHATEVER BEFALLS US IS FOR
A SINGLE HAIR OF OUR HEADS WILL FALL WITHOUT HIS WILL. AND HIS WILL IS
OF THE GOSPEL TRUTH WHICH HAS BECOME FOR ME A PRINCIPLE OF LIFE: NOT
CERTAIN. I WRITE ALL THIS TO YOU, DEAR FRIEND, ONLY TO CONVINCE YOU
THEN HAVE DISMISSED THEM WITH HORROR, BUT NOW THEY ARE VERY CLEAR AND
THE MOMENT OF OUR LOSS, THESE THOUGHTS COULD NOT OCCUR TO ME; I SHOULD
INFLUENCE ON ME AND ON MY BROTHER IN SPITE OF ALL OUR GRIEF. THEN, AT
HER ALONE, THAT EARLY AND TERRIBLE DEATH HAS HAD THE MOST BENEFICENT
THERE RECEIVE A PLACE I DARE NOT HOPE FOR MYSELF. BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF
ANDREW, WITH THE PUREST REGRETS AND MEMORIES, BUT PROBABLY SHE WILL
AS A MOTHER. AS IT IS, NOT ONLY HAS SHE LEFT US, AND PARTICULARLY PRINCE
YOUNG WIFE SHE WAS IRREPROACHABLE; PERHAPS SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO
INNOCENT TO HAVE THE STRENGTH TO PERFORM ALL A MOTHER'S DUTIES. AS A
LOVE FOR HIS CREATURES. PERHAPS, I OFTEN THINK, SHE WAS TOO ANGELICALLY
GENERALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US, IS BUT A MANIFESTATION OF HIS INFINITE
OF THE INFINITE GOODNESS OF THE CREATOR, WHOSE EVERY ACTION, THOUGH
WHY SHE HAD TO DIE, AND IN WHAT WAY THAT DEATH WAS BUT AN EXPRESSION
THEN, AND ALREADY I, WITH MY PETTY UNDERSTANDING, BEGIN TO SEE CLEARLY
DIE. AND WHAT DO YOU THINK, DEAR FRIEND? FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE
ANYONE, BUT IN WHOSE SOUL THERE WERE NEVER ANY UNKIND THOUGHTS, HAD TO
HAD TO DIE, SO I ASKED WHY THAT ANGEL LISE, WHO NOT ONLY NEVER WRONGED
IMPRESSION ON ME. JUST AS YOU ASK DESTINY WHY YOUR SPLENDID BROTHER
AND ONE I SHALL NEVER FORGET--THAT OF MY DEAR SISTER-IN-LAW--LEFT THAT
TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS, ARE LEFT LIVING. THE FIRST DEATH I SAW,
TO GOD, WHILE CRUEL, USELESS, HARMFUL PERSONS, OR SUCH AS ARE A BURDEN
HARMING NO ONE BUT NECESSARY TO THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS--ARE CALLED AWAY
CAUSE, KIND AND NOBLE BEINGS ABLE TO FIND HAPPINESS IN LIFE--NOT MERELY
EXPLAIN TO US WHAT WITHOUT ITS HELP MAN CANNOT COMPREHEND: WHY, FOR WHAT
WILL NOT SAY COMFORT US--BUT SAVE US FROM DESPAIR. RELIGION ALONE CAN

SPOKE OF THEIR FUTURE LIFE. PRINCE ANDREW WAS AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO
GO AWAY AND THE COUPLE, LEFT ALONE, STILL REMAINED SILENT. THEY RARELY
TOGETHER EVERYONE KEPT SILENT. SOMETIMES THE OTHERS WOULD GET UP AND

NATASHA DID NOT HEAR HIM.

THE PEOPLE AT THE BALL ALIKE WERE GOOD, KIND, AND SPLENDID PEOPLE,

"HOW CAN PEOPLE BE DISSATISFIED WITH ANYTHING?" THOUGHT NATASHA.

"YES, I AM VERY GLAD," HE SAID.

ON HER WAY TO SUPPER NATASHA PASSED HIM.

OVER HIS SPECTACLES SEEING NO ONE.
DEEP FURROW RAN ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD, AND STANDING BY A WINDOW HE STARED
HIS WIFE OCCUPIED IN COURT CIRCLES. HE WAS GLOOMY AND ABSENT-MINDED. A
AT THAT BALL PIERRE FOR THE FIRST TIME FELT HUMILIATED BY THE POSITION

EVIL, UNHAPPINESS, OR SORROW.
COMPLETELY KIND AND GOOD AND DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF
EVER BEEN IN HER LIFE. SHE WAS AT THAT HEIGHT OF BLISS WHEN ONE BECOMES
FATHER AND INSTANTLY DROPPED AGAIN. NATASHA WAS HAPPIER THAN SHE HAD
ANDREW NOTICED HOW HER THIN ARMS ROSE QUICKLY AS IF TO EMBRACE HER
"I HAVE NEVER ENJOYED MYSELF SO MUCH BEFORE!" SHE SAID, AND PRINCE

YOU ASK SUCH A QUESTION?"
ONCE BUT ONLY LOOKED UP WITH A SMILE THAT SAID REPROACHFULLY: "HOW CAN
HIS DAUGHTER WHETHER SHE WAS ENJOYING HERSELF. NATASHA DID NOT ANSWER AT
THE DANCERS. HE INVITED PRINCE ANDREW TO COME AND SEE THEM, AND ASKED
WHEN THE COTILLION WAS OVER THE OLD COUNT IN HIS BLUE COAT CAME UP TO

"WHAT RUBBISH SOMETIMES ENTERS ONE'S HEAD!" THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW, "BUT

WATCHED HER. SHE DID GO FIRST TO HER COUSIN.
MY WIFE," SAID PRINCE ANDREW TO HIMSELF QUITE TO HIS OWN SURPRISE, AS HE
"IF SHE GOES TO HER COUSIN FIRST AND THEN TO ANOTHER LADY, SHE WILL BE

LADIES FOR THE FIGURE.
WHEN HER PARTNER LEFT HER NATASHA RAN ACROSS THE ROOM TO CHOOSE TWO

UNIMPORTANT MATTERS; HE ADMIRED HER SHY GRACE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
TENDERNESS, SITTING BESIDE HER AND TALKING OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST
MISTAKES IN SPEAKING FRENCH. WITH HER HE BEHAVED WITH SPECIAL CARE AND
NATASHA, WITH HER SURPRISE, HER DELIGHT, HER SHYNESS, AND EVEN HER
SOMEONE THERE NOT OF THE CONVENTIONAL SOCIETY STAMP. AND SUCH WAS
LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE GROWN UP IN SOCIETY, PRINCE ANDREW LIKED MEETING

ASHAMED OF IN WHAT PRINCE ANDREW HAD OVERHEARD.
AND TRIED TO EXCUSE HERSELF, AS IF THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING TO BE
HAD INVOLUNTARILY OVERHEARD HER. NATASHA BLUSHED AT THAT RECOLLECTION
SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SLEEP THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT, AND TOLD HER HOW HE
REMINDED HER OF THEIR FIRST ENCOUNTER IN THE OTRADNOE AVENUE, AND HOW
COTILLIONS BEFORE SUPPER PRINCE ANDREW WAS AGAIN HER PARTNER. HE

DID NOT EVEN SEE THE EMPEROR, AND ONLY NOTICED THAT HE HAD GONE BECAUSE

PARTICULARLY GRACIOUS HE WAS TO A CERTAIN LADY, OR THAT PRINCE SO-AND-SO
THAT THE EMPEROR TALKED A LONG TIME WITH THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR, AND HOW
NOTHING OF WHAT OCCUPIED EVERYONE ELSE. NOT ONLY DID SHE FAIL TO NOTICE
SONYA, SHE DID NOT CEASE DANCING ALL THE EVENING. SHE NOTICED AND SAW
SO THAT, FLUSHED AND HAPPY, AND PASSING ON HER SUPERFLUOUS PARTNERS TO
THE AIDE-DE-CAMP WHO HAD OPENED THE BALL, AND SEVERAL OTHER YOUNG MEN,
AFTER PRINCE ANDREW, BORIS CAME UP TO ASK NATASHA FOR A DANCE, AND THEN

PIERRE CAME UP TO HIM AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM.

AND THE WOMEN WHO WERE BREATHLESSLY LONGING TO BE ASKED TO DANCE.
PRINCE ANDREW WAS WATCHING THESE MEN ABASHED BY THE EMPEROR'S PRESENCE,

HAD NOT YET GATHERED COURAGE TO ENTER THE CIRCLE.
GAZING NOW AT THE SOVEREIGN AND NOW AT THE MEN INTENDING TO DANCE WHO
WERE CURRENT. BUT NOT LISTENING TO WHAT FIRHOFF WAS SAYING, HE WAS
RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SITTING, CONCERNING WHICH VARIOUS RUMORS

SHE HUMMED A SCRAP FROM HER FAVORITE OPERA BY CHERUBINI, THREW HERSELF

SPLENDIDLY... AND HER VOICE! ONE CAN REALLY SAY IT'S A WONDERFUL VOICE!"
THEN SHE IS PRETTY, UNCOMMONLY PRETTY, AND AGILE--SHE SWIMS AND RIDES
CONTINUED THIS MAN. "SHE IS UNUSUALLY INTELLIGENT, CHARMING... AND
MEN--WHO WAS SAYING IT OF HER. "THERE IS EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN HER,"
AND IMAGINING IT WAS SOME VERY WISE MAN--THE WISEST AND BEST OF
CHARMING SHE IS," SHE WENT ON, SPEAKING OF HERSELF IN THE THIRD PERSON,
MAMMA DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. IT IS WONDERFUL HOW CLEVER I AM AND HOW...
FELL IN LOVE WITH NICHOLAS AND DOES NOT WISH TO KNOW ANYTHING MORE. EVEN
WITH HER ENORMOUS PLAIT OF HAIR. "NO, HOW COULD SHE? SHE'S VIRTUOUS. SHE
"SONYA?" SHE THOUGHT, GLANCING AT THAT CURLED-UP, SLEEPING LITTLE KITTEN

COULD UNDERSTAND ALL THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD AND ALL THERE WAS IN HER.
IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE SHE COULD SLEEP. SHE KEPT THINKING THAT NO ONE

RAN BAREFOOT TO HER OWN ROOM.
"YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP?" NATASHA JUMPED UP, SNATCHED UP HER SLIPPERS, AND
"LITTLE COUNTESS!" THE COUNT'S VOICE CALLED FROM BEHIND THE DOOR.

RED.... HOW CAN I EXPLAIN IT TO YOU?"
"NO, HE IS A FREEMASON, I HAVE FOUND OUT. HE IS FINE, DARK-BLUE AND

ANYBODY EVER SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH YOU? AND HE'S VERY NICE, VERY, VERY

"DON'T LAUGH, STOP!" CRIED NATASHA. "YOU'RE SHAKING THE WHOLE BED!

WENT OFF INTO A GOOD HUMORED, UNEXPECTED, ELDERLY LAUGH.
"JUST SO, JUST SO," REPEATED THE COUNTESS, AND SHAKING ALL OVER, SHE

"JUST SO. THERE'S NO NEED FOR ME TO MARRY HIM. BUT... JUST SO."

"HOW SO, MY PET?"

SMILED AND LOOKED AT HER MOTHER. "NOT TO MARRY, BUT JUST SO," SHE ADDED.
WON'T MARRY, BUT LET HIM COME IF HE ENJOYS IT AND I ENJOY IT." NATASHA
NATASHA IN THE TONE OF ONE BEING DEPRIVED OF HER PROPERTY. "WELL, I

"I'LL TELL YOU SOME THINGS ABOUT MYSELF. I HAD A COUSIN..."

"CRAZY?" REPEATED NATASHA.

WEALTHY MATCH, AND NOW HE'S HALF CRAZY."
IT TORMENTS HIM FOR NOTHING. HE MAY ALREADY HAVE FOUND A SUITABLE AND

"BUT IF I WANT TO..."

"LEAVE OFF TALKING NONSENSE," SAID THE COUNTESS.

 "BUT IF I WANT TO..." SAID NATASHA.

"I KNOW. IT IS NOT RIGHT, DARLING!"

"HOW DO YOU KNOW?"

AND BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF DON'T LOVE HIM."
"BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG, BECAUSE HE IS POOR, BECAUSE HE IS A RELATION...

"WHY NOT?" SAID NATASHA, WITHOUT CHANGING HER POSITION.

KNOW YOU CAN'T MARRY HIM."
"YOU HAVE QUITE TURNED HIS HEAD, AND WHY? WHAT DO YOU WANT OF HIM? YOU

"WELL, WHAT THEN?" SAID SHE.

NATASHA WAS LISTENING AND CONSIDERING.

PECULIARLY SERIOUS AND CONCENTRATED EXPRESSION.
ONLY SAW HER DAUGHTER'S FACE IN PROFILE. THAT FACE STRUCK HER BY ITS
SPHINXES CARVED ON THE CORNERS OF THE BEDSTEAD, SO THAT THE COUNTESS
WAS LYING LOOKING STEADILY STRAIGHT BEFORE HER AT ONE OF THE MAHOGANY
AS SHE SAID THIS THE COUNTESS LOOKED ROUND AT HER DAUGHTER. NATASHA

THAT...."
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT? YOU HAVE QUITE TURNED HIS HEAD, I CAN SEE
NICE. HE IS VERY NICE, AND I LOVE HIM LIKE A SON. BUT WHAT THEN?...
"NATASHA, YOU ARE SIXTEEN. AT YOUR AGE I WAS MARRIED. YOU SAY BORIS IS

ABOUT. DON'T SAY IT--I KNOW. NO, DO TELL ME!" AND SHE REMOVED HER HAND.
"ABOUT BORIS... I KNOW," SHE SAID SERIOUSLY; "THAT'S WHAT I HAVE COME

NATASHA PUT HER HAND ON HER MOTHER'S MOUTH.

"WHAT IS IT TONIGHT?--BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU..."

CLUB WERE ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES OF BOTH MOTHER, AND DAUGHTER.
THESE VISITS OF NATASHA'S AT NIGHT BEFORE THE COUNT RETURNED FROM HIS

SHE CLASPED HER MOTHER SHE ALWAYS MANAGED TO DO IT WITHOUT HURTING HER

STERN FACE, BUT SEEING, THAT NATASHA'S HEAD WAS COVERED, SHE SMILED IN
MOTHER. THE COUNTESS FINISHED HER PRAYERS AND CAME TO THE BED WITH A

DOWN, RAISING HER KNEES TO HER CHIN, KICKING OUT AND LAUGHING ALMOST
OVER TO THE WALL, AND BEGAN SNUGGLING UP THE BEDCLOTHES AS SHE SETTLED
THE ONE BELOW. NATASHA JUMPED ON IT, SANK INTO THE FEATHER BED, ROLLED
COUCH WAS HIGH, WITH A FEATHER BED AND FIVE PILLOWS EACH SMALLER THAN
JUMPED ONTO THE BED THE COUNTESS HAD FEARED MIGHT BECOME HER GRAVE. THIS
SLIPPING ONE LITTLE FOOT AGAINST THE OTHER, PUSHED OFF HER SLIPPERS AND
HER MOTHER WAS STILL PRAYING SHE RAN ON TIPTOE TO THE BED AND, RAPIDLY
UNCONSCIOUSLY PUT OUT HER TONGUE AS IF CHIDING HERSELF. SEEING THAT

ROUND AND FROWNED. SHE WAS FINISHING HER LAST PRAYER: "CAN IT BE THAT

UNDER HER WHITE COTTON CAP, KNELT SIGHING AND GROANING ON A RUG AND

DAY, AND YET HE CONTINUED TO SPEND WHOLE DAYS WITH THE ROSTOVS.
LEFT OFF VISITING HELENE AND RECEIVED REPROACHFUL NOTES FROM HER EVERY
KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DOING OR WHY HE CAME, OR HOW IT WOULD ALL END. HE
HE WENT AWAY IN A FOG, WITHOUT HAVING SAID WHAT HE MEANT TO, AND NOT
LETTING IT BE UNDERSTOOD HOW DELIGHTFUL WAS THE PRESENT; AND EVERY DAY
ALBUM, MAKING HIM WRITE IN IT, DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO ALLUDE TO THE PAST,
WITH BORIS AS OF OLD. SHE SANG HIM HIS FAVORITE SONGS, SHOWED HIM HER
ENTANGLED. IT SEEMED TO HER MOTHER AND SONYA THAT NATASHA WAS IN LOVE
ENTERING ON SUCH AN EXPLANATION. FROM DAY TO DAY HE BECAME MORE AND MORE
LET HER MARRY HIM. BUT HE FAILED TO DO SO AND FELT AWKWARD ABOUT
SHE COULD NOT BE HIS WIFE, THAT HE HAD NO MEANS, AND THEY WOULD NEVER
HER THAT THE OLD TIMES MUST BE FORGOTTEN, THAT IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING...
SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE AN EXPLANATION WITH NATASHA AND TELL
AND BEGAN CALLING OFTEN AND SPENDING WHOLE DAYS AT THE ROSTOVS'. IT
NATASHA, BUT DESPITE THAT RESOLUTION HE CALLED AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER
MARRY HER WOULD BE DISHONORABLE. BORIS MADE UP HIS MIND TO AVOID MEETING
HIS CAREER, WHILE TO RENEW THEIR FORMER RELATIONS WITHOUT INTENDING TO
BECAUSE TO MARRY HER, A GIRL ALMOST WITHOUT FORTUNE, WOULD MEAN RUIN TO
HIM JUST AS MUCH AS EVER, BUT THAT HE MUST NOT YIELD TO THAT FEELING,
HIM. AFTER HIS FIRST VISIT BORIS SAID TO HIMSELF THAT NATASHA ATTRACTED
SAME INQUISITIVE, CHALLENGING, AND RATHER MOCKING EYES STILL LOOKED AT
HE DID NOT STAY MORE THAN TEN MINUTES, THEN ROSE AND TOOK HIS LEAVE. THE
ROUND MORE FREQUENTLY TOWARD HER, AND BROKE OFF IN WHAT HE WAS SAYING.
BROWS. THIS GAZE DISTURBED AND CONFUSED BORIS MORE AND MORE. HE LOOKED
ALL THIS TIME NATASHA SAT SILENT, GLANCING UP AT HIM FROM UNDER HER

INVITATIONS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM N.N. AND S.S.
HIGHEST ARISTOCRACY, TO AN AMBASSADOR'S BALL HE HAD ATTENDED, AND TO
NOT ACCIDENTALLY, NATASHA FELT, THAT HE ALLUDED, WHEN SPEAKING OF THE
WITH MILD IRONY OLD TIMES IN MOSCOW AND MOSCOW ACQUAINTANCES. IT WAS
LIPS ABOUT THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE HIGHEST PETERSBURG SOCIETY, RECALLING
LIKE A SKIN, AND HE SPOKE WITH A PARTICULARLY REFINED COMPRESSION OF HIS
WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE CLEANEST OF GLOVES THAT FITTED HIS LEFT HAND
HE SAT RATHER SIDEWAYS IN THE ARMCHAIR NEXT TO THE COUNTESS, ARRANGING
COMME IL FAUT AND IN THE LATEST FASHION. THIS NATASHA NOTICED AT ONCE.
BORIS' UNIFORM, SPURS, TIE, AND THE WAY HIS HAIR WAS BRUSHED WERE ALL

OCCASIONALLY.
THE WEIGHT OF THAT RESOLUTE AND AFFECTIONATE SCRUTINY AND GLANCED AT HER
COUNTESS, SILENTLY AND MINUTELY STUDIED HER CHILDHOOD'S SUITOR. HE FELT
NATASHA SAT DOWN AND, WITHOUT JOINING IN BORIS' CONVERSATION WITH THE

"AND IS PAPA OLDER?" SHE ASKED.

"I SHOULD THINK SO!" REPLIED NATASHA'S LAUGHING EYES.

"HOW HANDSOME YOU HAVE GROWN!"

CHANGE IN HER.
BORIS KISSED NATASHA'S HAND AND SAID THAT HE WAS ASTONISHED AT THE

COUNTESS.
"WELL, DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR LITTLE MADCAP PLAYMATE?" ASKED THE

EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE PLEASED NATASHA.
NATASHA ENTERED, AND HIS FACE EXPRESSED RAPTUROUS ASTONISHMENT. THIS
FOUR YEARS BEFORE; AND SO HE WAS TAKEN ABACK WHEN QUITE A DIFFERENT
UNDER HER CURLS AND BOISTEROUS, CHILDISH LAUGHTER, AS HE HAD KNOWN HER
BORIS REMEMBERED NATASHA IN A SHORT DRESS, WITH DARK EYES SHINING FROM

OF HIS ARRIVAL SHE ALMOST RAN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM, FLUSHED AND BEAMING
THE ROSTOVS' DRAWING ROOM NATASHA WAS IN HER OWN ROOM. WHEN SHE HEARD
PETERSBURG, PLANS WHICH MIGHT VERY EASILY BE REALIZED. WHEN HE ENTERED
BEGINNING TO MAKE PLANS FOR MARRYING ONE OF THE RICHEST HEIRESSES IN
IMPORTANT PERSONAGE WHOSE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE HE ENJOYED, AND HE WAS
A BRILLIANT POSITION IN THE SERVICE THANKS TO THE PATRONAGE OF AN
POSITION IN SOCIETY THANKS TO HIS INTIMACY WITH COUNTESS BEZUKHOVA,
NATASHA COULD NOT BE BINDING EITHER ON HER OR ON HIM. HE HAD A BRILLIANT
HER AND HER PARENTS FEEL THAT THE CHILDISH RELATIONS BETWEEN HIMSELF AND
MOST POETIC RECOLLECTION. BUT HE WENT WITH THE FIRM INTENTION OF LETTING
HE DROVE TO THEIR HOUSE IN SOME AGITATION. THE MEMORY OF NATASHA WAS HIS

ON THEM.
WHICH HE HAD ENTERED. WHEN THE ROSTOVS CAME TO PETERSBURG BORIS CALLED
AND GRATEFULLY OF THE MERITS OF HER SON AND THE BRILLIANT CAREER ON
TO HOLD HERSELF WITH PARTICULAR DIGNITY, AND ALWAYS SPOKE RAPTUROUSLY
ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA ALSO HAD OF LATE VISITED THEM LESS FREQUENTLY, SEEMED

BORIS WAS MENTIONED.
"NOWADAYS OLD FRIENDS ARE NOT REMEMBERED," THE COUNTESS WOULD SAY WHEN

OF HIM.
THIS CONJECTURE WAS CONFIRMED BY THE SAD TONE IN WHICH HER ELDERS SPOKE
SOMETIMES IT OCCURRED TO NATASHA THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO SEE HER, AND

OTRADNOE, BUT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEE THEM.
ROSTOVS. HE HAD BEEN IN MOSCOW SEVERAL TIMES, AND HAD PASSED NEAR
SINCE BORIS LEFT MOSCOW IN 1805 TO JOIN THE ARMY HE HAD NOT SEEN THE

HER ENGAGEMENT TO BORIS WAS A JEST OR AN IMPORTANT, BINDING PROMISE

EPISODE AS OF SOME CHILDISH, LONG-FORGOTTEN MATTER THAT WAS NOT WORTH
BORIS HAPPENED TO BE MENTIONED, SHE SPOKE QUITE FREELY OF THAT
AGO. SINCE THEN SHE HAD NOT SEEN HIM. BEFORE SONYA AND HER MOTHER, IF
HAD COUNTED ON HER FINGERS WITH BORIS AFTER THEY HAD KISSED FOUR YEARS

THAT THE ROSTOVS INVOLUNTARILY CAME TO THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING,
BERG'S CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC WAS SUCH A NAIVE AND GOOD NATURED EGOTISM

HEAVIER IT GREW. AND SUDDENLY BROTHER A. CAME AND, TAKING MY ARM, LED
BITING ME. I LIFTED IT UP, BUT THE HIGHER I LIFTED IT THE BIGGER AND
MY HANDS. SCARCELY HAD I TORN IT OFF BEFORE ANOTHER, A BIGGER ONE, BEGAN
THIGH WITH ITS TEETH AND WOULD NOT LET GO. I BEGAN TO THROTTLE IT WITH
DOGS, BUT I WENT ON UNDISMAYED. SUDDENLY A SMALLISH DOG SEIZED MY LEFT
I DREAMED THAT I WAS WALKING IN THE DARK AND WAS SUDDENLY SURROUNDED BY

DROWSING OFF I CLEARLY HEARD A VOICE SAYING IN MY LEFT EAR, "THY DAY!"
SO THAT HE TOO MAY BENEFIT. AFTER DINNER I FELL ASLEEP AND AS I WAS
GRANT THAT IN HIS PRESENCE I MAY RATHER SEE MY OWN VILENESS, AND BEHAVE
TO MY RUDENESS WHILE I ON THE CONTRARY NOURISH CONTEMPT FOR HIM. O GOD,
MYSELF ABOVE HIM AND SO BECOME MUCH WORSE THAN HE, FOR HE IS LENIENT
CANNOT GET ON WITH HIM AT ALL. THE CAUSE OF THIS IS MY EGOTISM. I SET
SILENT, AND I RECOLLECTED MYSELF ONLY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE. MY GOD, I
UP AND SAID MUCH THAT WAS UNPLEASANT AND EVEN RUDE TO HIM. HE BECAME
FIRST, AND I SAID SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE TO HIM. HE REPLIED. I FLARED
CAME AND BEGAN RELATING VARIOUS ADVENTURES. HIS COMING VEXED ME FROM THE
ANGER, BUT I DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY REPENT. AFTERWARDS BORIS DRUBETSKOY
MYSELF AND DROVE AWAY THAT THOUGHT ONLY WHEN I FOUND MYSELF GLOWING WITH
MIND GAVE HIM THE MOST MALEVOLENT AND BITTER REPLIES. I RECOLLECTED
HIM NO ANSWER. NOW I RECALLED EVERY DETAIL OF THAT MEETING AND IN MY
PERFECT PEACE OF MIND IN SPITE OF MY WIFE'S ABSENCE. AT THE TIME I GAVE
MEETING ME IN MOSCOW AFTER OUR DUEL, SAID HE HOPED I WAS ENJOYING
IMAGINATION PICTURED AN OCCURRENCE OF FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN DOLOKHOV,

"YES, AND TO DRINK," ASSENTED NICHOLAS. "HULLO THERE! ANOTHER BOTTLE!"

"AND TO DRINK," SAID ONE OF THE OFFICERS, NOT WISHING TO QUARREL.

"OUR BUSINESS IS TO DO OUR DUTY, TO FIGHT AND NOT TO THINK! THAT'S

LISTENERS, BUT QUITE RELEVANTLY TO THE COURSE OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS.
BANGING THE TABLE--VERY LITTLE TO THE POINT AS IT SEEMED TO HIS
WAY WE SHALL BE SAYING THERE IS NO GOD--NOTHING!" SHOUTED NICHOLAS,
JUDGING AND ARGUING ABOUT EVERYTHING, NOTHING SACRED WILL BE LEFT! THAT
WITH HIM, IT MEANS THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IF ONCE WE BEGIN
PLEASES TO RECOGNIZE BONAPARTE AS EMPEROR AND TO CONCLUDE AN ALLIANCE

DENISOV'S CASE, WHEN HASTY STEPS AND THE JINGLING OF SPURS WERE HEARD
HARDLY HAD ROSTOV HANDED HIM THE LETTER AND FINISHED EXPLAINING

"I'M SORRY, SORRY FOR THAT FINE FELLOW. GIVE ME THE LETTER."

GRAVELY.
GENERAL KNEW. HAVING HEARD ROSTOV TO THE END, THE GENERAL SHOOK HIS HEAD
TOLD HIM THE WHOLE AFFAIR, ASKING HIM TO INTERCEDE FOR DENISOV, WHOM THE
JOCULAR FACE OF THE GENERAL, HE TOOK HIM ASIDE AND IN AN EXCITED VOICE
ROSTOV, IN DISMAY, BEGAN JUSTIFYING HIMSELF, BUT SEEING THE KINDLY,

WHICH ROSTOV WAS SERVING.
DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, AND WHO HAD FORMERLY COMMANDED THE DIVISION IN
IT WAS A CAVALRY GENERAL WHO HAD OBTAINED THE EMPEROR'S SPECIAL FAVOR

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, SIR, IN CIVILIAN DRESS?" ASKED A DEEP VOICE.

FAMILIAR VOICE CALLED HIM AND A HAND DETAINED HIM.
MAKING HIS WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE THROUGH THE BRILLIANT SUITE WHEN A
OF HIS CONDUCT AND REPENTING OF IT, ROSTOV, WITH DOWNCAST EYES, WAS
SHAME AND ARRESTED IN HIS PRESENCE, FULLY ALIVE NOW TO THE IMPROPRIETY
HIMSELF AT ANY MOMENT FACE TO FACE WITH THE EMPEROR AND BEING PUT TO
CURSING HIS TEMERITY, HIS HEART SINKING AT THE THOUGHT OF FINDING

MANY OFFICERS AND GENERALS IN FULL PARADE UNIFORM, WHOM HE HAD TO PASS.
ROSTOV WENT BACK INTO THE HALL AND NOTICED THAT IN THE PORCH THERE WERE

"WHAT AUDACITY! HAND IT IN THROUGH YOUR COMMANDER. AND GO ALONG WITH

"WHOM HAVE YOU COME FROM? WHO ARE YOU?"

ROSTOV TURNED AND WAS ABOUT TO GO, BUT THE MAN IN THE BRACES STOPPED

"LATER... LATER! TOMORROW. IT'S TOO LATE..."

"TELL HIM TO COME LATER. HE'LL BE COMING OUT DIRECTLY, WE MUST GO."

"ANOTHER PETITIONER," ANSWERED THE MAN WITH THE BRACES.

"WHAT IS IT?" ASKED THE PERSON IN THE OTHER ROOM.

"WHAT IS IT? A PETITION?"

ROSTOV, HE STOPPED SHORT AND FROWNED.
"A GOOD FIGURE AND IN HER FIRST BLOOM," HE WAS SAYING, BUT ON SEEING

ATTRACTED ROSTOV'S ATTENTION. THIS MAN WAS SPEAKING TO SOMEONE IN THE
NEW PAIR OF HANDSOME SILK-EMBROIDERED BRACES THAT, FOR SOME REASON,

A BATISTE SHIRT THAT HE HAD EVIDENTLY ONLY JUST PUT ON, STANDING IN THAT
A SHORT STOUT MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY, IN WHITE BREECHES AND HIGH BOOTS AND

ENTERED.
BUT THE OFFICIAL WHO HAD QUESTIONED HIM OPENED THE DOOR, AND ROSTOV
FASCINATING AND CONSEQUENTLY SO ALARMING THAT HE WAS READY TO RUN AWAY,
WAS DOING; THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE EMPEROR AT ANY MOMENT WAS SO
ON HEARING THIS INDIFFERENT VOICE, ROSTOV GREW FRIGHTENED AT WHAT HE

"A PETITION? THIS WAY, TO THE OFFICER ON DUTY" (HE WAS SHOWN THE DOOR

FRENCH WERE STILL REGARDED WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF ANGER, CONTEMPT,

ALL WERE SEATED AGAIN, TURNED WITH HIS KINDLY SMILE TO ROSTOV.
PIERRE SIGHED, ROSE SUBMISSIVELY, EMPTIED HIS GLASS, AND, WAITING TILL

EXASPERATION. "DON'T YOU HEAR IT'S HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR'S HEALTH?"
"WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT?" SHOUTED ROSTOV, LOOKING AT HIM IN AN ECSTASY OF

PIERRE, LOST IN THOUGHT, DID NOT RISE OR LIFT HIS GLASS.
NOT RESPONDED TO HIS GREETING. WHEN THE EMPEROR'S HEALTH WAS DRUNK,
PREOCCUPATION AND ABSENT-MINDEDNESS HAD NOT RECOGNIZED ROSTOV AND HAD
BEAUTY, AND IN A WORD--AN OLD WOMAN; AND SECONDLY BECAUSE PIERRE IN HIS
APPEARED TO HIS HUSSAR EYES AS A RICH CIVILIAN, THE HUSBAND OF A
AT THE DINNER. ROSTOV LOOKED INIMICALLY AT PIERRE, FIRST BECAUSE PIERRE
PREOCCUPIED, ABSENT-MINDED, AND MASSIVE FIGURE WAS A VERY NOTICEABLE ONE
RAKE, AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE GLANCED IRONICALLY AT PIERRE, WHOSE
WHOM WAS A DASHING HUSSAR AND THE OTHER A NOTORIOUS DUELIST AND
SEEMED VERY GAY. ROSTOV WAS TALKING MERRILY TO HIS TWO FRIENDS, ONE OF
DOLOKHOV, DENISOV, AND ROSTOV WERE NOW SITTING OPPOSITE PIERRE AND
AND AGAIN HE FELT SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS RISING IN HIS SOUL.
I, TOO, AM AFRAID OF HIM--AND IN FACT I AM AFRAID OF HIM," HE THOUGHT,
EVERYONE IS AFRAID OF HIM, AND THAT MUST PLEASE HIM. HE MUST THINK THAT
PIERRE, "TO KILL A MAN MEANS NOTHING TO HIM. IT MUST SEEM TO HIM THAT
ON DOLOKHOV'S FACE WHEN LOOKING AT HIM. "YES, HE IS A BULLY," THOUGHT
OR SHOT A POST-BOY'S HORSE WITH A PISTOL. THAT EXPRESSION WAS OFTEN
THE WATER, OR WHEN HE CHALLENGED A MAN TO A DUEL WITHOUT ANY REASON,
CRUELTY, AS WHEN TYING THE POLICEMAN TO THE BEAR AND DROPPING THEM INTO
REMEMBERED THE EXPRESSION DOLOKHOV'S FACE ASSUMED IN HIS MOMENTS OF
DO NOT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE NO RIGHT TO, AND CAN'T, BELIEVE IT." HE
OF DECEIVING ME, IF IT REALLY WERE TRUE. YES, IF IT WERE TRUE, BUT I
HIM. I KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHAT A SPICE THAT WOULD ADD TO THE PLEASURE
BECAUSE I HAVE EXERTED MYSELF ON HIS BEHALF, BEFRIENDED HIM, AND HELPED
PARTICULARLY PLEASANT TO HIM TO DISHONOR MY NAME AND RIDICULE ME, JUST
"YES, HE IS VERY HANDSOME," THOUGHT PIERRE, "AND I KNOW HIM. IT WOULD BE

NOT LEFT THEM FOR A DAY.
HIS WIFE'S BEAUTY TO HIM AND FROM THAT TIME TILL THEY CAME TO MOSCOW HAD
DOLOKHOV'S LIVING AT THEIR HOUSE, AND HOW CYNICALLY DOLOKHOV HAD PRAISED
MONEY. PIERRE RECALLED HOW HELENE HAD SMILINGLY EXPRESSED DISAPPROVAL OF
HAD COME STRAIGHT TO HIS HOUSE, AND PIERRE HAD PUT HIM UP AND LENT HIM
OF HIS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH PIERRE AS A BOON COMPANION, DOLOKHOV
CAMPAIGN, HAD RETURNED TO PETERSBURG AND COME TO HIM. AVAILING HIMSELF
HOW DOLOKHOV, WHO HAD FULLY RECOVERED HIS FORMER POSITION AFTER THE
TRUE HAD IT NOT REFERRED TO HIS WIFE. HE INVOLUNTARILY REMEMBERED
WHAT WAS SAID IN THE LETTER MIGHT BE TRUE, OR MIGHT AT LEAST SEEM TO BE
WIFE'S PAST AND HER RELATIONS WITH DOLOKHOV, PIERRE SAW CLEARLY THAT
RISING IN HIS SOUL AND TURNED QUICKLY AWAY. INVOLUNTARILY RECALLING HIS
HANDSOME INSOLENT EYES, PIERRE FELT SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS
WHO WAS SITTING OPPOSITE HIM. EVERY TIME HE CHANCED TO MEET DOLOKHOV'S
PRINCESS' HINTS AND THE LETTER, BUT HE FEARED NOW TO LOOK AT DOLOKHOV,
A SECRET TO NO ONE BUT HIMSELF. PIERRE ABSOLUTELY DISBELIEVED BOTH THE
THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES, BUT THAT HIS WIFE'S CONNECTION WITH DOLOKHOV WAS
THE MEAN JOCULAR WAY COMMON TO ANONYMOUS LETTERS SAID THAT HE SAW BADLY
WIFE, AND BY AN ANONYMOUS LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED THAT MORNING, WHICH IN
PRINCESS, HIS COUSIN, AT MOSCOW, CONCERNING DOLOKHOV'S INTIMACY WITH HIS
THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM THAT TORMENTED HIM WAS CAUSED BY HINTS GIVEN BY THE

DEPRESSING AND UNSOLVED PROBLEM.
NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HIM AND TO BE ABSORBED BY SOME
NOSE. HIS FACE WAS DEPRESSED AND GLOOMY. HE SEEMED TO SEE AND HEAR
A LOOK OF COMPLETE ABSENT-MINDEDNESS, KEPT RUBBING THE BRIDGE OF HIS
DINNER AND LOOKED ABOUT, BLINKING AND SCOWLING, OR, WITH FIXED EYES AND
SOME GREAT CHANGE HAD COME OVER HIM THAT DAY. HE WAS SILENT ALL THROUGH
DRANK MUCH, AND EAGERLY. BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM INTIMATELY NOTICED THAT
PIERRE SAT OPPOSITE DOLOKHOV AND NICHOLAS ROSTOV. AS USUAL, HE ATE AND

BROKEN GLASS AND EVERYBODY SAT DOWN AGAIN, SMILING AT THE NOISE THEY HAD
FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN THE VOICES SUBSIDED, THE FOOTMEN CLEARED AWAY THE
THE FLOOR. MANY FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE, AND THE LOUD SHOUTING CONTINUED
HE ROARED, "HURRAH!" AND EMPTYING HIS GLASS AT ONE GULP HE DASHED IT TO
OTHERS. HE NEARLY WEPT. "TO THE HEALTH OF OUR SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR!"
YOUNG ROSTOV'S ECSTATIC VOICE COULD BE HEARD ABOVE THE THREE HUNDRED
THE SAME VOICE IN WHICH HE HAD SHOUTED IT ON THE FIELD AT SCHON GRABERN.
AND CRIED "HURRAH!" BAGRATION ALSO ROSE AND SHOUTED "HURRAH!" IN EXACTLY
BAND IMMEDIATELY STRUCK UP "CONQUEST'S JOYFUL THUNDER WAKEN..." ALL ROSE

OTHER COMMITTEEMEN. "THERE WILL BE MANY TOASTS, IT'S TIME TO BEGIN," HE

FOOTMEN, AND AWAITED EACH EXPECTED DISH WITH SOME ANXIETY. EVERYTHING
END OF THE MEAL. HE WINKED AT THE BUTLER, WHISPERED DIRECTIONS TO THE
OTHER FARE, WAS SPLENDID, YET HE COULD NOT FEEL QUITE AT EASE TILL THE
HIS EFFORTS HAD NOT BEEN IN VAIN. THE DINNER, BOTH THE LENTEN AND THE

ALMOST AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE. FACING THEM SAT PIERRE, BESIDE PRINCE
NICHOLAS ROSTOV, WITH DENISOV AND HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE, DOLOKHOV, SAT

AND PROUDLY AROUND WHILE BAGRATION SPOKE TO HIS SON.
AS WERE ALL THE WORDS HE SPOKE THAT DAY, AND COUNT ILYA LOOKED JOYFULLY
WHO RECOGNIZED HIM AND SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM, DISJOINTED AND AWKWARD,
JUST BEFORE DINNER, COUNT ILYA ROSTOV PRESENTED HIS SON TO BAGRATION,

IMPORTANT THAN VERSES, AND BAGRATION, AGAIN PRECEDING ALL THE REST,
VERSES, BOWED TO BAGRATION. EVERYONE ROSE, FEELING THAT DINNER WAS MORE

   CONQUEST'S JOYFUL THUNDER WAKEN,

THE RESOUNDING STRAINS OF THE POLONAISE:
THAT DINNER WAS READY! THE DOOR OPENED, AND FROM THE DINING ROOM CAME

EXPRESSION. BUT THE AUTHOR HIMSELF TOOK THE VERSES AND BEGAN READING
HIS WEARY EYES ON THE PAPER, BEGAN TO READ THEM WITH A FIXED AND SERIOUS
"WELL, I WILL READ THEM, THEN!" BAGRATION SEEMED TO SAY, AND, FIXING

DINNER WITH IT) AND DREW HIS ATTENTION TO THE VERSES.

WITH BOTH HANDS AND LOOKED STERNLY AND REPROACHFULLY AT THE COUNT WHO
SUBMIT. FEELING HIMSELF IN THEIR POWER, HE RESOLUTELY TOOK THE SALVER
IN DISMAY, AS THOUGH SEEKING HELP. BUT ALL EYES DEMANDED THAT HE SHOULD
IN THE HERO'S HONOR. BAGRATION, ON SEEING THE SALVER, GLANCED AROUND
TO PRINCE BAGRATION. ON THE SALVER LAY SOME VERSES COMPOSED AND PRINTED
ANOTHER COMMITTEEMAN, CARRYING A LARGE SILVER SALVER WHICH HE PRESENTED
CROWD, WENT OUT OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND REAPPEARED A MINUTE LATER WITH
BESET THE NEW ARRIVALS. COUNT ILYA, AGAIN THRUSTING HIS WAY THROUGH THE

FIELD UNDER FIRE, AS HE HAD DONE AT THE HEAD OF THE KURSK REGIMENT AT
WHAT TO DO WITH HIS HANDS; HE WAS MORE ACCUSTOMED TO WALK OVER A PLOWED
AND AWKWARDLY OVER THE PARQUET FLOOR OF THE RECEPTION ROOM, NOT KNOWING
AT THE DOORS, BUT AFTER ALL HE DID AT LAST ENTER FIRST. HE WALKED SHYLY
WISHING TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THEIR COURTESY, AND THIS CAUSED SOME DELAY
AS THE GUEST OF HONOR, TO ENTER FIRST. BAGRATION WAS EMBARRASSED, NOT
UVAROV, WHO HAD ARRIVED WITH HIM, PAUSED AT THE DOORWAY TO ALLOW HIM,
FEATURES, GAVE HIM A RATHER COMICAL EXPRESSION. BEKLESHEV AND THEODORE
FESTIVE IN HIS AIR, WHICH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS FIRM AND VIRILE
WHICH CHANGED HIS APPEARANCE FOR THE WORSE. THERE WAS SOMETHING NAIVELY
BEFORE COMING TO THE DINNER HE HAD HAD HIS HAIR AND WHISKERS TRIMMED,
ORDERS, AND THE STAR OF ST. GEORGE ON HIS LEFT BREAST. EVIDENTLY JUST
OF AUSTERLITZ, BUT WORE A TIGHT NEW UNIFORM WITH RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN
OVER HIS SHOULDER, AS WHEN ROSTOV HAD SEEN HIM ON THE EVE OF THE BATTLE
PORTER. HE HAD NO LAMBSKIN CAP ON HIS HEAD, NOR HAD HE A LOADED WHIP
WHICH, IN ACCORD WITH THE CLUB CUSTOM, HE HAD GIVEN UP TO THE HALL
BAGRATION APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY OF THE ANTEROOM WITHOUT HAT OR SWORD,

OLD COUNT CAME UP TO THEM AND PRESSED DOLOKHOV'S HAND.
DOLOKHOV, WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE HE HAD LATELY MADE AND HIGHLY VALUED. THE
ON HIM AND WINKING JOYFULLY AT HIM. YOUNG ROSTOV STOOD AT A WINDOW WITH
EYES OCCASIONALLY SOUGHT OUT HIS FINE WELL-SET-UP YOUNG SON, RESTING
UNIMPORTANT, ALL OF WHOM HE KNEW, AS IF THEY WERE ALL EQUALS, WHILE HIS

FEEL THAT IN THAT PLACE AND ON THAT DAY, IT WAS IMPROPER TO SPEAK SO OF
COCK, BUT THE ELDER MEMBERS GLANCED SEVERELY AT THE WIT, MAKING HIM
LEARN FROM SUVOROV EVEN SO SIMPLE A THING AS THE ART OF CROWING LIKE A

VALUEV WAS CONFIDENTIALLY TELLING THAT UVAROV HAD BEEN SENT FROM

FORCE THEIR WAY THROUGH THEM WITH BAYONETS.
THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN OVERWHELMED BY FLYING AUSTRIANS AND HAD HAD TO
COUNT ROSTOPCHIN, VALUEV, AND NARYSHKIN. ROSTOPCHIN WAS DESCRIBING HOW
TO HEAR THE VOICES OF WELL-KNOWN MEN. THE LARGEST CIRCLES FORMED ROUND
WERE THE CENTER OF GROUPS WHICH EVEN STRANGERS APPROACHED RESPECTFULLY
SO HE WENT FROM ONE GROUP TO ANOTHER. SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OLD MEN
AND CONNECTIONS HE BELONGED TO THE GROUPS OLD AND HONORED GUESTS, AND
BY HIS AGE HE SHOULD HAVE BELONGED TO THE YOUNGER MEN, BUT BY HIS WEALTH

TREATED THEM WITH ABSENT-MINDED CONTEMPT.
WEALTH, AND BEING IN THE HABIT OF LORDING IT OVER THESE PEOPLE, HE

HIS HOUSE IN PETERSBURG, AND NOW... SHE HAS COME HERE AND THAT DAREDEVIL
COMPROMISED HER COMPLETELY, THEY SAY. PIERRE TOOK HIM UP, INVITED HIM TO

ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA SIGHED DEEPLY.

"WH-WHAT IS THE MATTER?" ASKED BOTH THE YOUNG AND OLD ROSTOV.

BEZUKHOV! YES, I PITY HIM FROM MY HEART, AND SHALL TRY TO GIVE HIM WHAT

"REALLY, PAPA, I BELIEVE PRINCE BAGRATION WORRIED HIMSELF LESS BEFORE

"SHALL WE HAVE THREE COLD DISHES THEN?" ASKED THE COOK.

"WELL THEN, MIND AND HAVE COCKS' COMB IN THE TURTLE SOUP, YOU KNOW!"

THEIR OWN RESOURCES WHAT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE FETE.
STILL FEWER MEN WOULD BE SO WELL ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE UP OUT OF

THE COUNT WALKED UP AND DOWN THE HALL IN HIS DRESSING GOWN, GIVING

A DINNER IN HONOR OF PRINCE BAGRATION AT THE ENGLISH CLUB.
AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH, OLD COUNT ILYA ROSTOV WAS VERY BUSY ARRANGING

SOCIETY WITH AN AFFECTATION OF DOING SO AGAINST HIS WILL. THE RACES, THE

KNOW. THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT LOVE WHEN I WANT TO, BUT
BE, AND THERE ARE, MANY MORE SUCH GIRLS SOMEWHERE WHOM I DO NOT YET
SONYA, DURING THIS STAY IN MOSCOW, HE SAID TO HIMSELF, "AH, THERE WILL

THE ADORATION THEN COMMON IN MOSCOW FOR THE EMPEROR, WHO WAS SPOKEN OF
EMPEROR NOT EVERYONE COULD UNDERSTAND, AND WITH HIS WHOLE SOUL HE SHARED
HAD NOT TOLD ALL AND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS FEELINGS FOR THE
ABOUT HIM AND ABOUT HIS LOVE FOR HIM, LETTING IT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE
HE DID NOT SEE HIM AND HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING HIM, HE OFTEN SPOKE
HIS PASSION FOR THE EMPEROR HAD COOLED SOMEWHAT IN MOSCOW. BUT STILL, AS

DENISOV, TO ROSTOV'S SURPRISE, APPEARED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WITH POMADED

MATCH--BLUSHED LIKE A GIRL.
THIS LOVE AFFAIR WHICH MIGHT HINDER NICHOLAS FROM MAKING A BRILLIANT
NICHOLAS, AND NATASHA, BUT EVEN THE OLD COUNTESS, WHO--DREADING
HER OBSERVATIONS, IT MADE EVERYONE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, NOT ONLY SONYA,
VERA'S REMARK WAS CORRECT, AS HER REMARKS ALWAYS WERE, BUT, LIKE MOST OF

STRANGERS."
"THAT SONYA AND NICHOLAS NOW SAY YOU TO ONE ANOTHER AND MEET LIKE
"HOW STRANGE IT IS," SAID VERA, SELECTING A MOMENT WHEN ALL WERE SILENT,

ANOTHER HE WOULD NEVER CEASE TO LOVE HER, FOR THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.
THANKED HER FOR OFFERING HIM HIS FREEDOM AND TOLD HER THAT ONE WAY OR
REMIND HIM OF HIS PROMISE, AND THEN THANKED HIM FOR HIS LOVE. HIS LOOKS
ASKED HIM TO FORGIVE HER FOR HAVING DARED, BY NATASHA'S INTERMEDIACY, TO

LOOKING INQUIRINGLY AT HIM AND WATCHING TO SEE HOW HE WOULD BEHAVE WITH

MEETING, THEY HAD KISSED EACH OTHER, BUT TODAY THEY FELT IT COULD NOT

ROSTOV MET SONYA IN THE DRAWING ROOM, HE REDDENED. HE DID NOT KNOW HOW
DANCER, BUT SMILING AS ONLY HAPPY GIRLS OF FIFTEEN CAN SMILE. WHEN
AND NATASHA ROSE AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM ON TIPTOE, LIKE A BALLET

"WELL THEN, BE QUICK. WE'LL ALL HAVE BREAKFAST TOGETHER."

"VERY."

"YOU CALL HIM VASKA? THAT'S FUNNY! AND IS HE VERY NICE?"

"WHY TERRIBLE?" ASKED NICHOLAS. "NO, VASKA IS A SPLENDID FELLOW."

"OH, WELL THEN, GOOD-BY: GO AND DRESS. IS HE VERY TERRIBLE, DENISOV?"

"YES, INDEED!"

SHE ASKED.
"BUT THAT'S ALL RUBBISH," NATASHA CHATTERED ON. "AND IS DENISOV NICE?"

"DEAR ME!" SAID ROSTOV.

WHEN I SEE HIM!"
NATASHA FLARED UP. "I DON'T WANT TO MARRY ANYONE. AND I'LL TELL HIM SO

"NICE! AND SO YOU NO LONGER WISH TO MARRY BORIS?"

"NO, BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S NICE?" SHE KEPT REPEATING.

ENVIOUS AND NATASHA COULD NOT HELP JOINING IN.
ROSTOV LAUGHED SO LOUD AND MERRILY THAT DENISOV, IN HIS BEDROOM, FELT

HER TOES ANY LONGER. "SO THAT'S WHAT I'M UP TO! I'LL NEVER MARRY ANYONE,
"SEE, I'M STANDING! SEE!" SHE SAID, BUT COULD NOT MAINTAIN HERSELF ON

TOGETHER, AND MADE SOME STEPS ON THE VERY TIPS OF HER TOES.
A FEW STEPS, TURNED, CUT A CAPER, BROUGHT HER LITTLE FEET SHARPLY
CURVING HER ARMS, NATASHA HELD OUT HER SKIRTS AS DANCERS DO, RAN BACK

THAT'S WHAT I'M UP TO."
"NOT SEEN DUPORT--THE FAMOUS DANCER? WELL THEN, YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND.

"NO."

SEEN DUPORT?"
"NOW?" REPEATED NATASHA, AND A HAPPY SMILE LIT UP HER FACE. "HAVE YOU

"DEAR ME! THEN WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW?"

OR ANYONE ELSE, AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING OF THE KIND."
"OH, WHAT NONSENSE!" CRIED NATASHA, LAUGHING. "I DON'T THINK ABOUT HIM

"WELL, AND ARE YOU STILL TRUE TO BORIS?" HE CONTINUED.

OH, HOW GLAD I AM TO HAVE YOU!"
"WELL THEN, THAT'S EXCELLENT," SAID HE. "WE'LL TALK IT OVER LATER ON.

"TURN THIS WAY!" HE SHOUTED, JUMPING OVER THE ICE WHICH CREAKED UNDER

AFTER LOSING HALF THEIR MEN WERE RETREATING IN DISORDERLY CONFUSED

THAN A HUNDRED CANNON WERE ALREADY IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH.
BEFORE FIVE IN THE EVENING THE BATTLE HAD BEEN LOST AT ALL POINTS. MORE


SILENCE, AND THEN THE SAME JOKE WAS REPEATED.
"OH, YOU FOOL!" SAID THE OLD MAN, SPITTING ANGRILY. SOME TIME PASSED IN

"GO, TIT! THRESH A BIT!"

"WHAT?" ANSWERED THE OLD MAN ABSENT-MINDEDLY.

"TIT! I SAY, TIT!" SAID THE GROOM.

FOLLOWED THEM. IN FRONT OF HIM WALKED KUTUZOV'S GROOM LEADING HORSES
NOT FAR OFF, IN THE VILLAGE THE VEHICLES WERE GOING TO. ROSTOV
PASSING BY. FROM ONE OF THE DRIVERS HE LEARNED THAT KUTUZOV'S STAFF WERE
WAS NO ONE BEYOND THE DITCH NOW. ONLY SOME CARTS AND CARRIAGES WERE
AND GALLOPED BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SEEN THE EMPEROR, BUT THERE
MADE USE OF IT.... "WHAT HAVE I DONE?" THOUGHT HE. AND HE TURNED ROUND
WAS A UNIQUE CHANCE TO SHOW HIS DEVOTION TO THE EMPEROR AND HE HAD NOT
HE MIGHT... NOT ONLY MIGHT BUT SHOULD, HAVE GONE UP TO THE SOVEREIGN. IT

THE CAUSE OF HIS GRIEF.
HIS DESPAIR WAS ALL THE GREATER FROM FEELING THAT HIS OWN WEAKNESS WAS

DESPAIR, NOT KNOWING WHERE TO OR WHY HE WAS NOW RIDING.
RESTRAINING HIS TEARS OF PITY FOR THE EMPEROR, HE RODE ON IN UTTER
"AND I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HIS PLACE!" THOUGHT ROSTOV, AND HARDLY

COVERED HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND AND PRESSED VON TOLL'S HAND.
LONG AND WARMLY TO THE EMPEROR AND HOW THE EMPEROR, EVIDENTLY WEEPING,
ROSTOV FROM A DISTANCE SAW WITH ENVY AND REMORSE HOW VON TOLL SPOKE
UNWELL, SAT DOWN UNDER AN APPLE TREE AND VON TOLL REMAINED BESIDE HIM.

WHO STILL REMAINED IN THE SAME ATTITUDE OF INDECISION.

REFLECTIONS. BETTER DIE A THOUSAND TIMES THAN RISK RECEIVING AN UNKIND
NO, CERTAINLY I MUST NOT APPROACH HIM, I MUST NOT INTRUDE ON HIS
FLANK NOW THAT IT IS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE BATTLE IS LOST?
"BESIDES HOW CAN I ASK THE EMPEROR FOR HIS INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE RIGHT

"BUT IT CAN'T BE HE, ALONE IN THE MIDST OF THIS EMPTY FIELD!" THOUGHT

MONARCH.
BY THAT GESTURE ROSTOV INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED HIS LAMENTED AND ADORED
HIS ATTENTION, MADE A GESTURE OF REFUSAL WITH HIS HEAD AND HAND AND
RIDER, WHOSE FIGURE SEEMED FAMILIAR TO ROSTOV AND INVOLUNTARILY RIVETED
THE WHITE PLUMES, EVIDENTLY SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD DO THE SAME. THE
HE AGAIN JUMPED THE DITCH, AND DEFERENTIALLY ADDRESSED THE HORSEMAN WITH

EMPEROR'S SUITE. ONE OFFICER TOLD ROSTOV THAT HE HAD SEEN SOMEONE FROM
TOLSTOY, WHO HAD RIDDEN OUT TO THE BATTLEFIELD WITH OTHERS IN THE
THE FIELD OF BATTLE WITH THE PALE AND TERRIFIED OBER-HOFMARSCHAL COUNT
SPREAD BY THE FACT THAT THE EMPEROR'S CARRIAGE HAD REALLY GALLOPED FROM
CORRECT, OTHERS THAT IT WAS NOT, AND EXPLAINED THE FALSE RUMOR THAT HAD
OR KUTUZOV WAS. SOME SAID THE REPORT THAT THE EMPEROR WAS WOUNDED WAS
WAS LOST. NO ONE WHOM ROSTOV ASKED COULD TELL HIM WHERE THE EMPEROR
SOUNDED FAR AWAY. HERE EVERYONE CLEARLY SAW AND SAID THAT THE BATTLE
DISORDERED. THE FRENCH CANNON DID NOT REACH THERE AND THE MUSKETRY FIRE

IN THE VILLAGE OF HOSJERADEK THERE WERE RUSSIAN TROOPS RETIRING FROM

AT ME?"
THOUGHT HE, "IF SHE SAW ME HERE NOW ON THIS FIELD WITH THE CANNON AIMED
HIMSELF. HE REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER'S LAST LETTER. "WHAT WOULD SHE FEEL,"
HIM MERGED IN ROSTOV'S MIND INTO A SINGLE FEELING OF TERROR AND PITY FOR
SENSATION OF THOSE TERRIBLE WHISTLING SOUNDS AND OF THE CORPSES AROUND

WOUNDED WHERE THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO FIRE AT, ON SEEING AN ADJUTANT

THESE UNFORTUNATES.
FOR THE COURAGE HE NEEDED AND WHICH HE KNEW WOULD NOT STAND THE SIGHT OF
THESE SUFFERING MEN, AND HE FELT AFRAID--AFRAID NOT FOR HIS LIFE, BUT
SO IT SEEMED TO ROSTOV. HE PUT HIS HORSE TO A TROT TO AVOID SEEING ALL
COULD HEAR THEIR DISTRESSING SCREAMS AND GROANS, SOMETIMES FEIGNED--OR
COUPLE OF ACRES. THE WOUNDED CREPT TOGETHER IN TWOS AND THREES AND ONE
ON WELL-KEPT PLOWLAND, LAY FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN DEAD AND WOUNDED TO EACH
WOUNDED--HAD LEFT IT LONG AGO. ALL ABOUT THE FIELD, LIKE HEAPS OF MANURE
OCCUPIED THAT REGION, AND THE RUSSIANS--THE UNINJURED AND SLIGHTLY
OF MEN HAD PERISHED IN FLEEING FROM PRATZEN. THE FRENCH HAD NOT YET
MYSELF?" HE THOUGHT. HE RODE ON TO THE REGION WHERE THE GREATEST NUMBER
"IT'S ALL THE SAME NOW. IF THE EMPEROR IS WOUNDED, AM I TO TRY TO SAVE

WOULD BE KILLED.
ROSTOV CONSIDERED, AND THEN WENT IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THEY SAID HE

WAY IS NEARER."
"OH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" SAID ANOTHER. "WHERE IS HE TO GO? THAT

SOLDIER SHOUTED TO HIM. "THEY'D KILL YOU THERE!"
"TAKE THIS ROAD, YOUR HONOR, THAT WAY YOU WILL BE KILLED AT ONCE!" A

TO THE TSAR OR TO KUTUZOV, EVEN IF THEY WERE ALIVE AND UNWOUNDED?
HE SAW TURRETS AND A CHURCH. WHAT NEED TO HURRY? WHAT WAS HE NOW TO SAY
DOUBT IT NOW. ROSTOV RODE IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT TO HIM, IN WHICH
GOING. THE EMPEROR WAS WOUNDED, THE BATTLE LOST. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
ROSTOV RODE ON AT A FOOTPACE NOT KNOWING WHY OR TO WHOM HE WAS NOW

WALKED ON.

MANY LEFT ALIVE. GO THAT WAY, TO THAT VILLAGE, ALL THE COMMANDERS ARE
"NOT KUTUZOV, BUT WHAT'S HIS NAME--WELL, NEVER MIND... THERE ARE NOT

"WHO? KUTUZOV?" ASKED ROSTOV.

"NOT KILLED--WOUNDED!" ANOTHER OFFICER CORRECTED HIM.

"WHO IS IT YOU WANT?" HE ASKED. "THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF? HE WAS KILLED

QUESTION HIM. THE MAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE TSAR HAD BEEN DRIVEN IN A

"EH, BROTHER! THEY'VE ALL BOLTED LONG AGO!" SAID THE SOLDIER, LAUGHING

AT LAST SEIZING A SOLDIER BY HIS COLLAR HE FORCED HIM TO ANSWER.

COULD STOP, BUT GOT NO ANSWER FROM ANYONE.
"WHERE IS THE EMPEROR? WHERE IS KUTUZOV?" ROSTOV KEPT ASKING EVERYONE HE

ROSTOV LEARNED LATER THAT RUSSIAN AND AUSTRIAN SOLDIERS HAD BEEN FIRING

IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS CANNON BEGAN FIRING FROM SOMEWHERE AND SMOKE
WITH RED EPAULETS, PROBABLY FRENCH. HE COULD SEE NOTHING MORE, FOR
THAT THEIR FOREMOST RANKS WERE MIXED UP WITH SOME FOREIGN CAVALRY
PASSED ROSTOV BEFORE HE HEARD THEM SHOUT, "HURRAH!" AND LOOKING BACK SAW
EXTENDING ITS NECK, GALLOPED ON YET FASTER. HARDLY HAD THE HORSE GUARDS
HIS HUGE SPURS IN VIOLENTLY, AND THE HORSE, FLOURISHING ITS TAIL AND
HIGH, SHIED, THROWING BACK ITS EARS; BUT THE POCKMARKED GUARDSMAN DROVE
THE EYES OF THE GUARDSMAN'S HORSE. THE HEAVY BLACK HORSE, SIXTEEN HANDS
AND HORSES) HAD IT NOT OCCURRED TO ROSTOV TO FLOURISH HIS WHIP BEFORE

THIS GUARDSMAN WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BOWLED ROSTOV AND HIS BEDOUIN OVER

THE LAST OF THE HORSE GUARDS, A HUGE POCKMARKED FELLOW, FROWNED ANGRILY

NOT IN TIME TO AVOID THEM.
GALLOPED ALONG THE FRONT AS HARD AS HIS HORSE COULD GO, BUT STILL WAS
ROSTOV, FEARING TO BE CRUSHED OR SWEPT INTO THE ATTACK ON THE FRENCH,
SHOUTED BY AN OFFICER WHO WAS URGING HIS THOROUGHBRED TO FULL SPEED.
ROSTOV COULD ALREADY SEE THEIR FACES AND HEARD THE COMMAND: "CHARGE!"
THE HORSE GUARDS WERE GALLOPING, BUT STILL HOLDING IN THEIR HORSES.

ADVANCING TO ATTACK THE FRENCH CAVALRY THAT WAS COMING TO MEET THEM.
EVEN THEIR FACES, MORE AND MORE DISTINCTLY. THEY WERE OUR HORSE GUARDS,
THE JINGLE OF THEIR WEAPONS AND SAW THEIR HORSES, THEIR FIGURES, AND
HORSES WERE ALREADY GALLOPING. ROSTOV HEARD THE THUD OF THEIR HOOFS AND
SAME SPEED, BUT THEY KEPT INCREASING THEIR PACE, SO THAT SOME OF THE
WAY OF THESE MEN, AND HE WOULD HAVE GOT CLEAR HAD THEY CONTINUED AT THE
ACROSS HIS PATH. ROSTOV PUT HIS HORSE TO FULL GALLOP TO GET OUT OF THE
UNIFORMS, MOUNTED ON BLACK HORSES, TROTTING STRAIGHT TOWARD HIM AND
WIDTH OF THE FIELD, AN ENORMOUS MASS OF CAVALRY IN BRILLIANT WHITE
HUNDRED YARDS AFTER THAT BEFORE HE SAW TO HIS LEFT, ACROSS THE WHOLE

INVOLUNTARILY NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM WAS BLEEDING, AND GALLOPED ON.
RANKS WERE RETURNING FROM THE ATTACK. ROSTOV GOT OUT OF THEIR WAY,
GALLOPING TOWARD HIM. THEY WERE OUR UHLANS WHO WITH DISORDERED
HE WAS RIDING ALMOST ALONG THE FRONT LINE. A HANDFUL OF MEN CAME

AFTER PASSING SOME AUSTRIAN TROOPS HE NOTICED THAT THE NEXT PART OF THE

ROSTOV.
"HOW IT WILL BE THERE I DON'T KNOW, BUT ALL WILL BE WELL!" THOUGHT

FARTHER INTO THE REGION WHERE THE ARMY WAS ALREADY IN ACTION.
AND AGAIN PROCEEDED TO GALLOP ALONG THE LINE, PENETRATING FARTHER AND
"GO ON! GO ON! GIVE IT THEM!" HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AT THESE SOUNDS,

CONTRARY, THEY STIMULATED HIS ENERGY AND DETERMINATION.
AND SOUNDS HAD NO DEPRESSING OR INTIMIDATING EFFECT ON HIM; ON THE
WHITHER, AND WHO THEY WERE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE OUT. THESE SIGHTS
WERE MOVING ABOUT, IN FRONT AND BEHIND MOVED LINES OF TROOPS; BUT WHY,
OUT ANYTHING OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING: THERE IN THE SMOKE MEN OF SOME SORT
ON, BUT STRAIN HIS ATTENTION AS HE WOULD HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND OR MAKE
ROSTOV STOPPED HIS HORSE FOR A MOMENT ON A HILLOCK TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING

LINES OF ARTILLERY WITH GREEN CAISSONS.
VISIBLE THROUGH THE SMOKE, MAKE OUT MOVING MASSES OF INFANTRY AND NARROW
AND MINGLING WITH ONE ANOTHER. HE COULD ALSO, BY THE GLEAM OF BAYONETS
DOWN THE HILLSIDES, AND CLOUDS OF CANNON SMOKE ROLLING, SPREADING,
HE COULD SEE PUFFS OF MUSKETRY SMOKE THAT SEEMED TO CHASE ONE ANOTHER

GENERAL ROAR.
SEVERAL OF THEM WERE NOT SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER BUT MERGED INTO A
PRATZEN, INTERRUPTED BY SUCH FREQUENT REPORTS OF CANNON THAT SOMETIMES
BUT A ROLL OF VOLLEYS OF MUSKETRY FROM THE SLOPES OF THE HILL BEFORE
AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS AS BEFORE, FOLLOWED BY ONE OR TWO CANNON SHOTS,
IN THE FRESH MORNING AIR WERE NOW HEARD, NOT TWO OR THREE MUSKET SHOTS

MUSKETRY AHEAD OF HIM. THE FIRING GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER.
PASSED UVAROV'S CAVALRY HE CLEARLY HEARD THE SOUND OF CANNON AND
AND HERE HE NOTICED A STIR AND SIGNS OF PREPARATION FOR BATTLE; HAVING
MOTIONLESS; THEN HE CAME TO THE REGION OCCUPIED BY UVAROV'S CAVALRY
TROOPS, WHICH HAD NOT YET ADVANCED INTO ACTION BUT WERE STANDING
GALLOPED ALONG THE LINE. AT FIRST HE RODE ALONG THE LINE OF BAGRATION'S
JOY AND HAPPINESS. ON RECEIVING THE ORDER HE GAVE HIS HORSE THE REIN AND
WAS BRIGHT, HE HAD A GOOD HORSE UNDER HIM, AND HIS HEART WAS FULL OF
MESSAGE TO KUTUZOV, PERHAPS EVEN TO THE SOVEREIGN HIMSELF. THE MORNING
ORDERLY TO THE BRAVEST GENERAL, AND STILL MORE, HE WAS GOING WITH A
GENERAL ENGAGEMENT IN WHICH HE WAS TAKING PART, MORE THAN THAT, HE WAS
ALL HIS WISHES WERE BEING FULFILLED THAT MORNING: THERE WAS TO BE A

STATE OF MIND WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM POSSIBLE, PLEASANT, AND EASY.
ELASTICITY OF MOVEMENT, FAITH IN HIS GOOD FORTUNE, AND GENERALLY IN THAT
HOURS' SLEEP BEFORE MORNING AND FELT CHEERFUL, BOLD, AND RESOLUTE, WITH
ON BEING RELIEVED FROM PICKET DUTY ROSTOV HAD MANAGED TO GET A FEW

"YOU CAN GIVE THE MESSAGE TO HIS MAJESTY," SAID DOLGORUKOV, HURRIEDLY

LIT WISPS OF STRAW AND RAN AFTER HIM, SHOUTING, "VIVE L'EMPEREUR!"
EMPEROR HIMSELF RODE ROUND HIS BIVOUACS. THE SOLDIERS, ON SEEING HIM,
THAT WHILE NAPOLEON'S PROCLAMATION WAS BEING READ TO THE TROOPS THE
THE FIRES AND SHOUTING IN THE ENEMY'S ARMY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FACT


"THANK GOD!"

THOUGHT ROSTOV.
"TOMORROW VERY LIKELY I MAY BE SENT WITH SOME MESSAGE TO THE EMPEROR,"

"I WILL GIVE THE ORDER."

"THEN I MAY RECKON ON IT, YOUR EXCELLENCY?"

BUT ROSTOV DID NOT REPLY.

"COUNT ILYA ROSTOV'S SON?" ASKED DOLGORUKOV.

"OH, VERY WELL, YOU MAY STAY IN ATTENDANCE ON ME."

"COUNT ROSTOV."

"WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"

THE FIRST SQUADRON?"
"TOMORROW OUR SQUADRON IS TO BE IN RESERVE. MAY I ASK TO BE ATTACHED TO

"VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD," SAID BAGRATION. "THANK YOU, OFFICER."

AND ESPECIALLY BY THE SOUND OF THE BULLETS.

"IT'S PLAIN THAT THEY HAVE NOT ALL GONE YET, PRINCE," SAID BAGRATION.

RETREAT AND LEAVE THE PICKETS."
"WHAT DOES THAT PROVE?" HE WAS SAYING AS ROSTOV RODE UP. "THEY MIGHT

ONLY LIT FIRES TO DECEIVE US.
DOLGORUKOV WAS STILL INSISTING THAT THE FRENCH HAD RETREATED AND HAD

AND WITH HIS HAND AT THE SALUTE RODE UP TO THE GENERAL.
ONLY WHEN APPROACHING BAGRATION DID ROSTOV LET HIS HORSE GALLOP AGAIN,

SHOTS CAME.
MORE! SOME MORE!" A MERRY VOICE WAS SAYING IN HIS SOUL. BUT NO MORE
LIKE HIS OWN, AT THE FIRING, AND WENT BACK AT A FOOTPACE. "WELL, SOME
DIFFERENT TONES. ROSTOV REINED IN HIS HORSE, WHOSE SPIRITS HAD RISEN,
AT INTERVALS, AND THE BULLETS PASSED SOMEWHERE IN THE FOG SINGING IN
ROSTOV TURNED HIS HORSE AND GALLOPED BACK. FOUR MORE REPORTS FOLLOWED
OUT OF HEARING. ANOTHER MUSKET MISSED FIRE BUT FLASHED IN THE PAN.
AND A BULLET WHIZZING HIGH UP IN THE MIST WITH A PLAINTIVE SOUND PASSED

THE FRENCH PICKETS HAD BEEN STANDING THAT EVENING.

GLEAMED WHITE IN THE MIST WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
AND RIDE OVER THE BLACK FIELD UP THE HILLSIDE. TO KEEP TO THE ROAD WHICH
HE REINED IN HIS HORSE, HESITATING WHETHER TO RIDE ALONG IT OR CROSS IT
WHEN HE REACHED IT HE FOUND IT WAS A ROAD. HAVING COME OUT ONTO THE ROAD
DISTINCTLY. IN THE VALLEY HE SAW BEFORE HIM SOMETHING LIKE A RIVER, BUT
THE ENEMY'S FIRES, BUT HEARD THE SHOUTING OF THE FRENCH MORE LOUDLY AND
HAVING DESCENDED THE HILL AT A TROT, HE NO LONGER SAW EITHER OUR OWN OR
FOR TREES AND GULLIES FOR MEN AND CONTINUALLY DISCOVERING HIS MISTAKES.
HIM AND DID NOT STOP BUT RODE ON AND ON, CONTINUALLY MISTAKING BUSHES
THE HILL NOT TO GO BEYOND THE STREAM, BUT ROSTOV PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR
DISTANCE WHERE NO ONE HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM. BAGRATION CALLED TO HIM FROM
RIDING ALONE WITH THREE HUSSARS INTO THAT MYSTERIOUS AND DANGEROUS MISTY
FROM WHICH THE SHOUTING CAME. HE FELT BOTH FRIGHTENED AND PLEASED TO BE
HUSSARS, TOLD THEM TO FOLLOW HIM, AND TROTTED DOWNHILL IN THE DIRECTION

"WELL, GO AND SEE," HE SAID, AFTER A PAUSE.

BAGRATION STOPPED AND, BEFORE REPLYING, TRIED TO SEE ROSTOV'S FACE IN

SHALL I GO WITH SOME OF MY HUSSARS TO SEE?" REPLIED ROSTOV.
"THEY WERE THERE THIS EVENING, BUT NOW I DON'T KNOW, YOUR EXCELLENCY.

SAID BAGRATION TO ROSTOV, "ARE THE ENEMY'S SKIRMISHERS STILL THERE?"
THEY HAD RETREATED THEY WOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THAT TOO.... OFFICER!"
"HARDLY," SAID BAGRATION. "I SAW THEM THIS EVENING ON THAT KNOLL; IF

KINDLE FIRES AND MAKE A NOISE TO DECEIVE US."
NOTHING BUT A TRICK! HE HAS RETREATED AND ORDERED THE REARGUARD TO

THE SERGEANT TO MEET SOME MOUNTED MEN WHO WERE RIDING ALONG THE LINE.
ROSTOV, STILL LOOKING ROUND TOWARD THE FIRES AND THE SHOUTS, RODE WITH

"YOUR HONOR, THE GENERALS!" SAID THE SERGEANT, RIDING UP TO ROSTOV.

SUDDENLY APPEARED, LOOMING HUGE AS AN ELEPHANT.
HEARD, AND OUT OF THE FOGGY DARKNESS THE FIGURE OF A SERGEANT OF HUSSARS
OF HORSE'S HOOFS APPROACHING AT A TROT ALONG THE LINE OF HUSSARS WAS
THE HUSSAR ONLY SIGHED WITHOUT REPLYING AND COUGHED ANGRILY. THE SOUND

HUSSAR BESIDE HIM.
"THEY CAN'T BE FAR OFF, PROBABLY JUST BEYOND THE STREAM," HE SAID TO THE

DISTINCTLY.
STIMULATING EFFECT ON HIM. "VIVE L'EMPEREUR! L'EMPEREUR!" HE NOW HEARD
WANTED TO SLEEP. THE GAY TRIUMPHANT SHOUTING OF THE ENEMY ARMY HAD A
FARTHER, PROBABLY ALONG THE LINE OF THE FRENCH CAMP. ROSTOV NO LONGER
OF SEVERAL THOUSAND MEN COULD PRODUCE. THE LIGHTS SPREAD FARTHER AND
GREW STILL LOUDER AND MERGED INTO A GENERAL ROAR THAT ONLY AN ARMY
PRICKING ITS EARS AT THE NOISE AND LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS. THE SHOUTING
ROSTOV'S HORSE WAS ALSO GETTING RESTIVE: IT PAWED THE FROZEN GROUND,

STEADY!" HE CRIED TO HIS FIDGETING HORSE.
"IT MAY BE HE OR IT MAY BE NOTHING," MUTTERED THE HUSSAR. "IT'S DARK...

"FROM THE DIRECTION, IT MUST BE THE ENEMY," REPEATED ROSTOV.

"WHO CAN TELL, YOUR HONOR?" REPLIED THE HUSSAR RELUCTANTLY.

"WHY, DON'T YOU HEAR IT?" ROSTOV ASKED AGAIN, AFTER WAITING FOR A REPLY.

THE HUSSAR DID NOT REPLY.

"WHAT'S THAT? WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?" SAID ROSTOV TO THE HUSSAR BESIDE

PRICKED THEIR EARS AT THESE SHOUTS. OVER THERE, WHERE THE SHOUTING CAME
OF THOUSANDS OF VOICES. HIS HORSE AND THE HORSE OF THE HUSSAR NEAR HIM
HE HEARD IN FRONT OF HIM, WHERE THE ENEMY WAS, THE LONG-DRAWN SHOUTS

SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS BEING FIRED AT. "WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?... CUT THEM
RIGHT!" AND HIS HEAD ONCE MORE SANK TO HIS HORSE'S NECK. ALL AT ONCE IT
THING I WAS THINKING OF. YES, NA-TASHA, SABRETACHE, OH, YES, YES! THAT'S
BUT THAT'S NONSENSE, THE CHIEF THING IS NOT TO FORGET THE IMPORTANT
WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT DARED NOT.... NO, IT WAS I WHO DARED NOT.
THE CHIEF THING IS THAT THE EMPEROR IS HERE. HOW HE LOOKED AT ME AND
OLD GURYEV.... OH, BUT DENISOV'S A FINE FELLOW. BUT THAT'S ALL NONSENSE.

HIS HORSE TO RIDE ONCE MORE ROUND HIS HUSSARS. IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT

DISSATISFIED WITH HIM, AND ALSO THAT AT THE EMPEROR'S HEADQUARTERS
DISSATISFIED ABOUT SOMETHING AND THAT AT HEADQUARTERS THEY WERE

ENTHUSIASM--WAS ONLY THE LOSS OF THE BATTLE OF AUSTERLITZ, THE SO-CALLED

ACTIVITIES OF 160,000 RUSSIANS AND FRENCH--ALL THEIR PASSIONS, DESIRES,

NO WAY BINDING) MIGHT GIVE TIME FOR PART OF THE TRANSPORT TO PASS, AND

KUTUZOV TO REPORT THE OFFER HE HAD RECEIVED.
AUTHORIZED EITHER TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE A TRUCE AND SENT HIS ADJUTANT TO

AUSTRIAN GENERAL OCCUPYING THE ADVANCED POSTS, BELIEVED MURAT'S EMISSARY
OFFERED THIS TRUCE TO AVOID UNNECESSARY BLOODSHED. COUNT NOSTITZ, THE

HER LIP DESCENDED. SHE BROUGHT HER FACE CLOSE TO HER SISTER-IN-LAW'S AND

THE FACE OF THE LITTLE PRINCESS CHANGED. SHE SIGHED AND SAID: "YES,

DESCRIPTION OF THE LAST PETERSBURG FETE SHE ADDRESSED HER BROTHER:
THOUGHT INDEPENDENT OF HER SISTER-IN-LAW'S WORDS. IN THE MIDST OF A
OF LOVE AND SADNESS. IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE WAS FOLLOWING A TRAIN OF
STILL LOOKING SILENTLY AT HER BROTHER AND HER BEAUTIFUL EYES WERE FULL
A REAL ONE, BUT THAT THEY WOULD TALK OF THAT LATER. PRINCESS MARY WAS
ODYNTSOVA HAD MARRIED AN OLD MAN, AND THAT THERE WAS A SUITOR FOR MARY,
TO DRESS IN HERE; AND THAT ANDREW HAD QUITE CHANGED, AND THAT KITTY
ALL HER CLOTHES IN PETERSBURG AND THAT HEAVEN KNEW WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE

HAD ON THE SPASSKI HILL WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERIOUS FOR HER IN HER
GLITTERING TEETH AND SPARKLING EYES. SHE TOLD OF AN ACCIDENT THEY HAD

TURNED TOWARD HER BROTHER, AND THROUGH HER TEARS THE LOVING, WARM,
HE TOLD HER SHE WAS STILL THE SAME CRYBABY AS EVER. PRINCESS MARY HAD
PRINCE ANDREW AND HIS SISTER, HAND IN HAND, KISSED ONE ANOTHER, AND

"I DREAMED LAST NIGHT..."--"YOU WERE NOT EXPECTING US?..." "AH! MARY,
"AH! MY DEAR!... AH! MARY!" THEY SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED, AND THEN LAUGHED.

HEADS THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE AT THIS MEETING.
NATURAL THAT THEY SHOULD CRY, AND APPARENTLY IT NEVER ENTERED THEIR
ANDREW EVIDENTLY FELT ILL AT EASE, BUT TO THE TWO WOMEN IT SEEMED QUITE
CRY AND KISSED AGAIN. MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE ALSO BEGAN TO CRY. PRINCE
OTHER ON THE FACE, AND THEN TO PRINCE ANDREW'S SURPRISE BOTH BEGAN TO
HANDS, KISSING THEM AND PULLING THEM AWAY, AND AGAIN BEGAN KISSING EACH
ANOTHER, AND THEN, AS IF AFRAID OF BEING TOO LATE, SEIZED EACH OTHER'S
OF MUSIC DO WHEN THEY HEAR A FALSE NOTE. THE TWO WOMEN LET GO OF ONE
LAUGH. PRINCE ANDREW SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND FROWNED, AS LOVERS
HEART, WITH A BEATIFIC SMILE AND OBVIOUSLY EQUALLY READY TO CRY OR TO
TOUCH. MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE STOOD NEAR THEM PRESSING HER HAND TO HER
ARMS WARMLY PRESSING THEIR LIPS TO WHATEVER PLACE THEY HAPPENED TO
MET ONCE BEFORE FOR A SHORT TIME AT HIS WEDDING, WERE IN EACH OTHER'S
OF KISSING. WHEN PRINCE ANDREW WENT IN THE TWO PRINCESSES, WHO HAD ONLY

BEFORE THEY REACHED THE ROOM FROM WHICH THE SOUNDS OF THE CLAVICHORD

KISSED HIS HAND.
"YOU'VE GROWN OLDER, TIKHON," HE SAID IN PASSING TO THE OLD MAN, WHO

PRINCE ANDREW FOLLOWED HER WITH A COURTEOUS BUT SAD EXPRESSION.

"IS THAT MARY PRACTICING? LET'S GO QUIETLY AND TAKE HER BY SURPRISE."

MERRILY AND PRETTILY AS EVER.
AND HER SHORT, DOWNY, SMILING LIP LIFTED WHEN SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK JUST AS

LAST, AND, HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF THAT THEY HAD NOT, HE TURNED TO HIS
ASCERTAIN WHETHER HIS FATHER'S HABITS HAD CHANGED SINCE HE WAS AT HOME
APPARENTLY KNEW THIS AS WELL AS TIKHON; HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AS IF TO
MUST BE ALLOWED TO DISTURB THE APPOINTED ORDER OF THE DAY. PRINCE ANDREW
TIKHON KNEW THAT NEITHER THE SON'S ARRIVAL NOR ANY OTHER UNUSUAL EVENT
A WHISPER THAT THE PRINCE WAS SLEEPING, AND HASTILY CLOSED THE DOOR.
A WIG, PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE DOOR OF THE ANTECHAMBER, REPORTED IN
ALIGHT, AND LET HER PASS INTO THE HOUSE BEFORE HIM. OLD TIKHON, WEARING
PORCH. PRINCE ANDREW GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE, HELPED HIS LITTLE WIFE TO

A NEEDLE THAN FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD, ARE TERRIBLY

TO HEAR SOMETHING VERY PROFOUND. AT LAST HE CAME UP TO MORIO. HERE THE
REFINED EXPRESSION ON THE FACES OF THOSE PRESENT HE WAS ALWAYS EXPECTING

IN A TOYSHOP, DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK, AFRAID OF MISSING ANY
INTELLECTUAL LIGHTS OF PETERSBURG WERE GATHERED THERE AND, LIKE A CHILD

PIERRE HAD BEEN EDUCATED ABROAD, AND THIS RECEPTION AT ANNA PAVLOVNA'S

AGAIN WHEN HE PASSED TO ANOTHER GROUP WHOSE CENTER WAS THE ABBE.
THE GROUP ROUND MORTEMART TO LISTEN TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID THERE, AND
PIERRE WAS EVIDENT. SHE KEPT AN ANXIOUS WATCH ON HIM WHEN HE APPROACHED
PROPER, AND REGULAR MOTION. BUT AMID THESE CARES HER ANXIETY ABOUT
WORD OR SLIGHT REARRANGEMENT KEPT THE CONVERSATIONAL MACHINE IN STEADY,

THE FOREMAN OF A SPINNING MILL, WHEN HE HAS SET THE HANDS TO WORK, GOES
TO HELP AT ANY POINT WHERE THE CONVERSATION MIGHT HAPPEN TO FLAG. AS
RESUMED HER DUTIES AS HOSTESS AND CONTINUED TO LISTEN AND WATCH, READY
AND HAVING GOT RID OF THIS YOUNG MAN WHO DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE, SHE

"WE WILL TALK OF IT LATER," SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA WITH A SMILE.

HE BEGAN EXPLAINING HIS REASONS FOR THINKING THE ABBE'S PLAN CHIMERICAL.
WISHED TO GET AWAY. WITH HIS HEAD BENT, AND HIS BIG FEET SPREAD APART,
FINISHED SPEAKING TO HIM, AND NOW HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK TO ANOTHER WHO

INTERESTING BUT HARDLY FEASIBLE."
"YES, I HAVE HEARD OF HIS SCHEME FOR PERPETUAL PEACE, AND IT IS VERY

PAVLOVNA IN DISMAY DETAINED HIM WITH THE WORDS: "DO YOU KNOW THE ABBE

ANNA PAVLOVNA'S ALARM WAS JUSTIFIED, FOR PIERRE TURNED AWAY FROM THE

OF SOMETHING TOO LARGE AND UNSUITED TO THE PLACE, CAME OVER HER FACE
THIS LOWEST-GRADE GREETING, A LOOK OF ANXIETY AND FEAR, AS AT THE SIGHT
ACCORDED TO THE LOWEST HIERARCHY IN HER DRAWING ROOM. BUT IN SPITE OF
FIRST APPEARANCE IN SOCIETY. ANNA PAVLOVNA GREETED HIM WITH THE NOD SHE
