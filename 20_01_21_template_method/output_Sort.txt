A RECEIPT FOR SUCH AND SUCH STORES RECEIVED. IF NOT, AS THE DEMAND WAS
A RED BALL THROUGH THE DUST, BURNED AND SCORCHED HIS BACK INTOLERABLY
A RED FACE WAS DANCING THE TREPAK WITH MUCH SPIRIT AND AGILITY.
A REGIMENT WOULD RUIN HIM. PIERRE LISTENED TO HIM, SCARCELY ABLE TO
A REGIMENT. I CANNOT STAND IT HERE. HEADQUARTERS ARE SO FULL OF GERMANS
A REGIMENTAL BUT A COSSACK HORSE. A JUDGE OF HORSES AND A SPORTSMAN,
A REMARKABLE CROP THAT YEAR, HAD BEEN COMMANDEERED BY THE TROOPS AND

A REPUTATION FOR BRAVERY, AND THERE WAS SOMETHING HE COULD NOT AT ALL

A RUMOR IMMEDIATELY SPREAD IN PETERSBURG, NOT THAT HELENE WANTED TO

A SECRET TO NO ONE BUT HIMSELF. PIERRE ABSOLUTELY DISBELIEVED BOTH THE
A SENSE OF DISGUST THE MINUTEST DETAILS OF THIS HUMILIATING SCENE HE
A SENSE OF PITY HE HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN OVERFLOWED PIERRE'S HEART.
A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND ARGUMENTS PROVES TO EVERY MAN THAT HE, AS
A SERIOUS EXPRESSION, BUT WITH A SMILE LURKING AT THE CORNERS OF HIS
A SERVANT WHO PASSED OUT ON TIPTOE WITHOUT HEEDING THEM. THEY WENT INTO
A SERVANT. FROM THERE THEY PASSED INTO ANOTHER ROOM. A MAN IN STRANGE
A SERVICE OF PRAYER. ALL THAT DENISOV HAD SAID WAS CLEVER AND TO THE
A SEVEN TO TURN UP, GAZED AT DOLOKHOV'S HANDS WHICH HELD THE PACK. MUCH
A SEVENTY-POUND WEIGHT WERE TIED TO IT. HE COULD RUN NO MORE. THE
A SHADE OF CONTEMPT FOR THE YOUTHFULNESS OF THIS OFFICER AND WITH A HAND
A SHADE OF MELANCHOLY, EVIDENTLY RELATING TO THE YOUNG MAN'S RECENT LOSS

A SHELL BURST IN THE MIDST OF THAT DENSE THRONG, KILLING SOME AND
A SHELL TORE UP THE EARTH TWO PACES FROM PIERRE AND HE LOOKED AROUND
A SHORT PAUSE. "BESIDES, WOULD THE PRINCESS HAVE ME? AND BESIDES, SHE IS
A SHORT STOUT MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY, IN WHITE BREECHES AND HIGH BOOTS AND
A SHOT, AND OUR TROOPS COULD BE SEEN HURRYING TO THE CROSSING.
A SHREWD, KINDLY, YET SUBTLY DERISIVE EXPRESSION LIT UP KUTUZOV'S PODGY
A SINCERE DESIRE TO ACT ON THIS ADVICE. IN THE EVENING HE CAME BACK TO
A SINGLE ARMED ENEMY REMAINS IN MY COUNTRY!" IT SEEMED TO BORIS THAT IT
A SINGLE HAIR OF OUR HEADS WILL FALL WITHOUT HIS WILL. AND HIS WILL IS
A SINKING HEART THE MOVEMENT OF DOLOKHOV'S HANDS. THOSE BROAD, REDDISH
A SINKING MAN WHO CLUTCHES AT ANOTHER AND DROWNS HIM; OR A HUNGRY MOTHER
A SLEIGH DRAWN BY TWO GRAY TROTTING-HORSES THAT WERE BESPATTERING THE
A SLIPPER FOR HIS LEFT FOOT. WITH A CHILDLIKE SMILE OF EMBARRASSMENT,
A SLUR ON MY NAME? A MISFORTUNE FOR LIFE? OH, THAT'S NONSENSE," HE
A SMALL BUNDLE OF SCRAPS FROM INSIDE HIS SHIRT AND GAVE IT TO THE
A SMALL CLOUD HAD SCATTERED SOME RAINDROPS LIGHTLY, SPRINKLING THE ROAD
A SMALL OBJECT. KUTUZOV SEEMED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF
A SMALL PARTY AND MOVED IN DENISOV'S VICINITY), THE COMMANDERS OF SOME
A SMELL OF PERFUME, AND PUT IT TO NESVITSKI'S NOSE.
A SMILE OF JOY AND SATISFACTION LIT UP HER EAGER FACE.
A SMILE OF PLEASURE NEVER LEFT NATASHA'S FACE. SHE FELT HAPPY AND AS IF
A SMILE THAT BROADENED HIS ROUND FACE MORE AND MORE, PREPARED THE
A SMILE.
A SNUB NOSE. HIS PALE WAXEN FACE WAS STILL FRECKLED AND HIS EYES WERE
A SOFA IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM. HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND SEEMED TO BE
A SOLDIER IN A PEAKED CAP AND BLUE OVERCOAT, LIT UP BY THE FIRE, WAS
A SOLDIER ON THE MARCH IS HEMMED IN AND BORNE ALONG BY HIS REGIMENT AS
A SOLDIER WITH A SACK OVER HIS SHOULDER, STOPPED, CAME CLOSE UP TO
A SOLDIER, AUNT, I DON'T FORCE MYSELF ON ANYONE OR REFUSE ANYTHING," HE
A SOLDIER, HE SHOULD BE DRESSED IN REGULATION UNIFORM LIKE THE OTHERS."
A SOLEMN MEETING OF THE LODGE OF THE SECOND DEGREE WAS CONVENED, AT
A SOLEMN SILENCE, LISTENING TO THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT, WHO HELD A
A SOLUTION OF THAT QUESTION.
A SORT OF PRESENTIMENT THAT IT WOULD NOT COME OFF. SHE IS A STERILE
A SOUL HE HAS!"
A SPACE LIKE A STREET WAS LEFT BETWEEN EACH TWO LINES OF TROOPS. THE
A SPECIAL ENCLOSURE WHERE THERE ARE OATS--THAT THIS VERY RAM, SWELLING
A SPECIAL ESTRANGEMENT FROM THE MEMBERS OF HER OWN FAMILY. ALL OF
A SPECIAL GRATUITY FOR HIS FAITHFUL SERVICES, WELL KNOWING THAT AT THAT
A SPECIAL SMILE IN ADDITION TO HER USUAL SMILE AS HOSTESS. LOOKING AT
A SPECTACLED DOCTOR WAS CUTTING INTO HIS MUSCULAR BROWN BACK.
A SPIRITUAL WOUND PRODUCED BY A RENDING OF THE SPIRITUAL BODY IS LIKE
A STAND THERE BEHIND A WATTLE FENCE IN A GARDEN THICKLY OVERGROWN WITH
A STATE OF ALARM AND COMMOTION. NATASHA WAS VERY ILL, HAVING, AS MARYA
A STATE, LIVE LIKE BROTHERS, RENDER MUTUAL AID AND PROTECTION ONE TO
A STEP, AND WITH HIS WHOLE WEIGHT, AS IF LYING DOWN TO REST, FELL ON
A STERN AIR. SHE WORE HER HOLIDAY SHAWL, IN WHICH SHE PAID CALLS, AND
A STILL-STRONGER AGITATION OF MINGLED JOY AND FEAR SEIZED HIS SOUL. HE
A STORM AT THE SQUARE, CUT HIS WAY IN, SLASHED RIGHT AND LEFT, HOW HIS
A STORY, HEARD FROM HER AUNT BUT FINISHED IN HER OWN WAY, WHICH SHE
A STOUT MAJOR WAS PACING UP AND DOWN THE LINE, AND REGARDLESS OF THE
A STRANGE FEELING OF EXASPERATION AND YET OF RESPECT FOR THIS MAN'S
A STRATEGIST AND THE CONQUEROR OF NAPOLEON? HAD HE NOT SEEN THE
A STRAW ABOUT ANYONE BUT THOSE I LOVE; BUT THOSE I LOVE, I LOVE SO THAT
A STRETCHER THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT. THE SOLDIER GROANED.
A STRONG IMPRESSION ON PRINCE ANDREW ON THE WEDNESDAY, WHEN HE
A STUFFY ROOM, SO A WHIFF OF YOUTHFULNESS, ENERGY, AND CONFIDENCE OF
A SUBJECT HOWEVER TRIVIAL IT MAY BE, AND THAT THERE IS NO SUBJECT SO
A SUBJECT NEAR TO HER OWN HEART, SHE COULD NOT RECONCILE HERSELF TO THE
A SUBMISSIVE TENDER LOVE FOR THIS MAN WHO WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ALL
A SUFFERING CHILD AND TO WRING HER LITTLE HANDS EVEN WITH SOME
A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF POWDER, AND PRINCE ANDREW STARTED TO ONE SIDE,
A SUPERIOR OFFICER PERHAPS. YOU HAVE BORNE ARMS AGAINST US. THAT'S NOT
A SUPPRESSED SMILE OF THE JOY OF LIFE, NOW WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED AND
A SURGEON WHO HAS JUST PERFORMED A DIFFICULT OPERATION AND ADMITS THE

ACTIVITY IN 1812, NEVER ONCE SWERVING BY WORD OR DEED FROM BORODINO TO
ACTIVITY IN WHICH NO ONE COULD BE JUSTIFIED OR GUILTY--A REALM OF
ACTIVITY IS CONSIDERED BY THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE TO BE THE CAUSE OR
ACTIVITY OF ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE TENDENCY THAT THEN PREVAILED IN
ACTIVITY OF MEN AND THEIR HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS, JUST AS SUCH A
ACTIVITY OF SOME DOZEN PEOPLE WHO DID NOT BURN HOUSES, PRACTICE
ACTIVITY OF THE MILLIONS WHO MIGRATE, BURN HOUSES, ABANDON AGRICULTURE,
ACTIVITY OF THOSE MEN AS REPRESENTING THE ACTIVITY OF THE WHOLE NATION.
ACTIVITY WAS SO UNSWERVINGLY DIRECTED TO A SINGLE AIM; AND IT WOULD BE

AN ATTENDANT DEFERENTIALLY AND QUICKLY SLIPPED BEFORE THE LADIES AND

AN AUSTRIAN GENERAL COMPLAINED OF ME. I CONGRATULATED HIM ON MACK'S
AN AUSTRIAN OFFICER IN A WHITE UNIFORM WITH GREEN PLUMES IN HIS HAT
AN AWKWARD SILENCE FOLLOWED THESE WORDS. NATASHA WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK,

AN UNACKNOWLEDGED SENSE OF THE GUILT OF THAT DESIRE PARALYZED HIS WILL.
AN UNCONSCIOUSLY HAPPY SMILE. OCCASIONALLY HE ROSE AND WALKED ABOUT THE

AND IMMEDIATELY, HEARING BEHIND HIM THE TRAMP OF THE HORSES OF HIS
AND IMMUTABLY SELF-CONFIDENT MEN, SELF-CONFIDENT TO THE POINT OF

AND IN EVERY MOTION, SHE LOOKED AT THE VISITORS AND, WITH A PLEASANT
AND IN FACT THE HEAD IN THE NIGHTCAP WAS LIFTED AT ONCE. ON
AND IN FACT TOLL, TO WHOM HE WENT TO COMMUNICATE THE NEWS, IMMEDIATELY

AND IN ORDER TO PRESS THEM AGAIN TO HER LIPS, SHE SLIGHTLY PUSHED AWAY
AND IN ORDER TO REALIZE VIVIDLY HIS LOVE DEVOTION TO THE SOVEREIGN,
AND IN OTHER PARTS OF OUR REALM FOR CONSULTATION, AND FOR THE DIRECTION

AND IN PLACE OF AN INTELLECT (GROUPING EVENTS AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS)
AND IN PROOF OF THE CONCLUSIVENESS OF HIS OPINION ALL THE WRINKLES

AND IN THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE ONE COULD NOT DISREGARD ONESELF AND ONE'S
AND IN THE NIGHT FROM THE NINETEENTH TO THE TWENTIETH, THE WHOLE EIGHTY
AND IN THE SAME PLACE. NO, IT CAN'T BE! SURELY IT WILL ALL END IN
AND IN WHAT MONTH?' HE ASKED ALL ABOUT IT AND HIS HEART BEGAN TO ACHE.
AND INAPT BUT SHE ATTAINED HER OBJECT. THE CONVERSATION WAS RESUMED, AND
AND INDEED EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM LOOKED WITH A SMILE OF PLEASURE AT THE

AND INDULGENTLY TO SMOOTH WITH IT THE HEART OF HIS NEIGHBOR. AS TO THE
AND INDUSTRIOUS ARTISANS, RETURN TO YOUR WORK, YOUR HOUSES, YOUR SHOPS,

AND INHUMAN ROLE PREDESTINED FOR HIM.
AND INSIGNIA HE SAW THE UNIFORMS AND DECORATIONS AT WHICH THEY AIMED IN
AND INSIGNIFICANCE--PARTICULARLY ACUTE BY CONTRAST WITH THE SPHERE OF

AND KINDS OF DESSERT, IN ORDER TO SEND A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE DINNER
AND KISSED IT.
AND KNEW HOW UNPLEASANT EVERY SIGN OF ANXIETY ON HIS ACCOUNT WAS TO HIM.
AND KNEW THAT HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH DEATH. WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF
AND KNEW THAT THE CHIEF WAY TO MAKE THEM OBEY IS TO SHOW NO SUSPICION
AND KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM ALL! IT'S QUITE ASTONISHING. HOW DID YOU

AND LED FIRST TO ONE AND THEN TO ANOTHER PLACE WITH DOZENS OF OTHER MEN,
AND LEGS ALWAYS FELL INTO UNNATURAL POSITIONS.

AND LIEUTENANT TELYANIN, A SMALL OFFICER OF THE SAME SQUADRON, ENTERED
AND LIFE--THAT MADE HIS PERSONALITY WHAT IT WAS AND FROM WHICH THE
AND LIFTED IT TO HIS LIPS, THREW BACK HIS HEAD, AND RAISED HIS FREE HAND
AND LIGHT, JOYOUS STEPS. AT THE VISITORS' REQUEST THE YOUNG PEOPLE SANG
AND LIKE A PRACTICAL PETERSBURG LADY WHO KNOWS HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF
AND LISTENED TO HER. IN THE MIDST OF A PHRASE HE CEASED SPEAKING AND
AND LISTENED TO STORIES OF POTEMKIN'S AND SUVOROV'S CAMPAIGNS, OR TO
AND LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION OF HIS TWO NEIGHBORS, WHOM HE EGGED ON
AND LOCKED UP THE CHURCH. THAT NIGHT THE DOORS WERE AGAIN BROKEN
AND LOOKED AT HER IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOT ONLY COULD SHE NOT BEAR HIS
AND LOOKED AT HIM CLOSELY.
AND LOOKED ECSTATICALLY AT THE SPOT WHERE NAPOLEON HAD BEEN BUT WHERE HE
AND LOOKED ROUND WITH A SMILE. SHE WAS, AS ALWAYS AT EVENING PARTIES,
AND LOOKED UP AT PIERRE WHO WAS JUST APPROACHING THEM.
AND LOOKING SEVERELY AT THE DISHES IN FRONT OF KUTUZOV HE BEGAN TO
AND LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WITH A SMILE THAT DID NOT LEAVE HIS

AND MORE RAPTUROUS JOY. EVERY WORD OF PIERRE'S BURNED INTO HIS HEART,
AND MORE SUBJECT TO NECESSITY THAN THOSE OF A MAN LIVING IN SOLITUDE AND
AND MORE THAN FORTY BORZOIS, SO THAT, WITH THE BORZOIS ON THE LEASH
AND MORE THAN SWEET, LOOKED AT HIM FROM THOSE ATTENTIVE EYES.
AND MORE THAN THAT, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT YOU DO NOT THINK SO

AND WAS JUST PUTTING HIS QUESTION TO A SOLDIER WHEN HIS ATTENTION

EVENING PARTIES. BERG AND VERA COULD NOT REPRESS THEIR SMILES OF
EVENING PASSED, NIGHT CAME, AND THE FEELING OF SUSPENSE AND SOFTENING OF
EVENING THE SKY CLEARED AGAIN AND THE SUN SET IN REDDISH-BROWN MIST.
EVENING THEY HAD TALKED OVER EVERYTHING AND THE CONVERSATION PASSED FROM

EVENING WHEN THE REWARDS BESTOWED BY THE EMPEROR WERE MENTIONED.
EVENING WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO EAT. ERMOLOV WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
EVENING, BROUGHT HIM TO MOSCOW BY DAYBREAK, AND DRIVEN HIM BACK AGAIN
EVENING, HE WENT INTO THE LARGE DIVISION OF THE TENT AT THREE O'CLOCK IN
EVENING, HOWEVER, AS THE WIFE'S FACE GREW MORE FLUSHED AND ANIMATED, THE
EVENING, THE ADJUTANTS HAD SPREAD IT TO ALL ENDS AND PARTS OF THE ARMY,
EVENING--WITHOUT EVEN ASKING HIMSELF WHAT THEY WERE WANTED FOR--HE
EVENING.
EVENING. (THIS WAS THE BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO.) HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE IN
EVENINGS FOR YEARS, SHE REGRETTED JULIE'S PRESENCE AND HAVING NO ONE TO
EVENLY, AND THEN RAISED HIS HEAD. HE HAD AN INTELLECTUAL AND DISTINCTIVE
EVENT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED, WE FORGET ABOUT THE OTHERS THAT WERE NOT
EVENT NOT OCCURRED THESE HINTS WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN, AS WE HAVE
EVENT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE. NAPOLEON III ISSUES A DECREE AND THE
EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER, ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY
EVENT!"
EVENT, ACTED IN AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT MANNER FROM KUTUZOV.
EVENT, AS FOR INSTANCE IN A WAR OR A REVOLUTION, AND SO WITHOUT ASSUMING
EVENT, JOYFUL OR SAD, THAT TOOK PLACE IN THAT HOUSE WAS IMPORTANT TO ALL
EVENT--FROM AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF MOST DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WAS ONLY
EVENT--THE ABANDONMENT AND BURNING OF MOSCOW--AND TRIED WITH HIS PUNY
EVENT.
EVENT. IN THE ENGLISH CLUB, WHERE ALL WHO WERE DISTINGUISHED, IMPORTANT,
EVENT. TO US, THE WISH OR OBJECTION OF THIS OR THAT FRENCH CORPORAL TO
EVENTS (THAT IS TO SAY, EVENTS THE REASONABLENESS OF WHICH WE DO
EVENTS ABOUT TO HAPPEN--DESPITE THEIR FORMER HORROR AND DETESTATION OF
EVENTS HAVE NO COMMON SENSE AND ARE ALL CONTRADICTORY, AS IN THE CASE OF
EVENTS IN THE WILL OF ONE MAN; HE IS AS RIGHT AS THE RUSSIAN HISTORIANS

EVENTS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS TREATED ONE

EVENTS THE SO-CALLED GREAT MEN ARE LABELS GIVING NAMES TO EVENTS, AND
EVENTS THEN OCCURING LAY IN THE NATIONAL FEELING WHICH HE POSSESSED IN
EVENTS WERE INEVITABLE.
EVENTS, AND BOWED HIS OLD HEAD IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE AS IF EXPECTING AND
EVENTS, REMEMBRANCE OF REMOTE ONES, AND THE CHILDISH VANITY WITH WHICH
EVENTS--THE LOSS OF ALMOST THE WHOLE OF THE ROSTOVS' MOSCOW
EVENTS. HIS ACTIONS--WITHOUT THE SMALLEST DEVIATION--WERE ALL DIRECTED
EVENTS. THE INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF THIS DEDUCTION IS THAT, HOWEVER MANY
EVENTS? THEN LISTEN:
EVENTUALITY COULD ALTER THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DRISSA CAMP, THAT
EVER BECAUSE ANATOLE'S PRESENCE HAD VIVIDLY RECALLED TO HER THE TIME
EVER BEEN IN HER LIFE. SHE WAS AT THAT HEIGHT OF BLISS WHEN ONE BECOMES
EVER BEEN TO ANY MAN. NATASHA KEPT TURNING TO HELENE AND TO HER FATHER,
EVER HEARD HIM UTTER A GROAN OR A WORD OF COMPLAINT. FROM MORNING TILL
EVER SINCE HE HAD OVERTAKEN THE REGIMENT IN POLAND, HAD LIVED WITH THE
EVER SINCE THAT LEAVE OF ABSENCE HAD EXPIRED, MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT
EVER SINCE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO, FOR ALL THE GENERALS WHO CAME TO
EVER STRONGER AND FULLER AND MERGING INTO A DEAFENING ROAR.
EVER WAS BORIS RESOLVED TO SERVE IN FUTURE NOT ACCORDING TO THE WRITTEN
EVER, ONLY SHOWING STILL MORE IRRITABILITY AND SKEPTICISM AS TO WHAT WAS
EVER-INCREASING AMIABILITY AT THE OTHER GUESTS. NATASHA, WHO SAT
EVER-INCREASING CROWDS MOVING TOWARD THE KREMLIN, THE LESS HE REMEMBERED
EVER-INCREASING RESTLESSNESS, WHICH HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN, TOOK
EVER-LUCKY GAMBLER WHO, AFTER RECKLESSLY FLINGING MONEY ABOUT AND ALWAYS
EVERY ACT OF THEIRS, WHICH APPEARS TO THEM AN ACT OF THEIR OWN WILL, IS
EVERY ARMY IS COMPOSED OF LOWER GRADES OF THE SERVICE--THE RANK AND
EVERY BIT OF IT IS OCCASIONED BY THE FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP,
EVERY CORNER OF THE EMPIRE, RECEIVING COMPLAINTS, REDRESSING WRONGS,
EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE CONNECTED WITH HER, THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR
EVERY DECISION WOULD BE APPROVED BY THEM ALL WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS.
EVERY DETAIL OF THE INTERVIEW WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE RUSSIAN MONARCH,
EVERY EVENTUALITY, EVERY POSSIBILITY EVEN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL! NO, MY
EVERY EYE SHE MET NOW WAS IMMEDIATELY DROPPED.
EVERY FOOTSTEP IN THAT HOUSE SINCE THE TERRIBLE NEWS HAD COME, SO NOW
EVERY HONEST MAN'S DUTY TO GO AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THE OATH
EVERY HOUSE IN MOZHAYSK HAD SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN IT, AND AT THE HOSTEL
EVERY HUMAN ACTION APPEARS TO US AS A CERTAIN COMBINATION OF FREEDOM AND
EVERY LETTER.
EVERY LOSS, THE LIVELINESS INCREASED MORE AND MORE.
EVERY MOMENT OF THE LIFE OF KINGS AS A TOOL FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES.
EVERY MOMENT, NOT EXPLAINING OR CONSOLING, BUT RECALLING HER TO LIFE.
EVERY MOMENT. THEY ARE MY ENEMIES. IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS.
EVERY MUSCLE OF TELYANIN'S PALE, TERRIFIED FACE BEGAN TO QUIVER, HIS
EVERY RUSSIAN LOOKING AT MOSCOW FEELS HER TO BE A MOTHER; EVERY
EVERY RUSSIAN MIGHT HAVE PREDICTED IT, NOT BY REASONING BUT BY THE
EVERY RUSSIAN. BUT WHY ARE YOU SO ANXIOUS? YOU HAVE STILL TIME TO GET
EVERY SHADE IN THE PLAY OF EXPRESSION ON THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO HAD
EVERY STEP, BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS' ACCOUNTS ARE ALL MADE UP OF
EVERY STEP.
EVERY TEN SECONDS A CANNON BALL FLEW COMPRESSING THE AIR AROUND, OR
EVERY TIME THAT, POINTER IN HAND, SHE SAT DOWN TO SHOW HIM THE FRENCH
EVERY TIME THERE HAS BEEN A REVOLUTION IN ANY STATE THERE HAVE BEEN
EVERY TURN.
EVERY VIOLENT REFORM DESERVES CENSURE, FOR IT QUITE FAILS TO REMEDY
EVERY WAY..."
EVERY WORD AND GESTURE HE SAW ALLUSIONS TO HIS HAPPINESS. HE OFTEN
EVERY WORD AND MOVEMENT WAS DESCRIBED WITH ECSTASY.
EVERY WORD HE ADDED: "BUT DON'T HURT MY LITTLE HORSE!" AND STROKED THE
EVERY WORD THAT HE OR NATASHA HAD SPOKEN AND PICTURED EVERY DETAIL OF
EVERYBODY ADVISED MAKING THE ATTEMPT. AFTER MUCH DISPUTING AND ARGUING,
EVERYBODY FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN
EVERYBODY GOT UP HE WENT ALONG, LIMPING, AND, WHEN HE HAD WARMED UP,
EVERYBODY IS SUFFERING, TORTURED, AND BEING CORRUPTED, AND THAT IT
EVERYBODY LAUGHED A GREAT DEAL. AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE, WHERE THE
EVERYBODY LAUGHED, AND HIPPOLYTE LOUDER THAN ANYONE. HE WAS EVIDENTLY
EVERYBODY WAS ASKING WHAT SHOULD BE DONE, AND ALL WERE TRYING TO CALM
EVERYBODY WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES, AS IF WISHING TO INTERCEPT EVERY GLANCE
EVERYBODY WOULD GO INTO RAPTURES OVER EVERY WORD OF HERS AND LOOK FOR A

EVERYBODY, EQUALLY PLEASED TO SEE EVERYONE, AND EQUALLY INDIFFERENT TO
EVERYDAY DRESS. NOW PLEASE, DO IT FOR MY SAKE. KATIE," SHE SAID TO THE
EVERYONE ABOUT ANATOLE. ONE MAN TOLD HIM HE HAD NOT COME YET, AND
EVERYONE ADOPTED TOWARD HIM THE TONE OF MEN WHO KNOW SOMETHING OTHERS DO
EVERYONE AGAIN LOOKED TOWARD THE DOOR, WHICH CREAKED AS THE SECOND

EVERYONE BEGAN TO RUN.
EVERYONE BELIEVED IN THE MERIT AND USEFULNESS OF HIS DEED, AND HE HAD
EVERYONE CAME TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIM AND THEY ALL WEPT.
EVERYONE DUCKED. IT FLOPPED INTO SOMETHING MOIST, AND THE GENERAL FELL
EVERYONE ELSE WHO OPPOSED HIS THEORY. BUT BESIDES THIS FEELING OF
EVERYONE ELSE, HIS FLIGHT FROM HOME, THE PEASANT COAT, THE PISTOL, AND
EVERYONE HAS," HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE.
EVERYONE IN SOCIETY, LEANED OVER AND SPOKE TO HER.
EVERYONE IN SUCH CASES--THAT IT WAS MERELY SOME SILLY WHIM THAT SEIZED
EVERYONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM.
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE REALIZED FOR WHOSE SAKE PRINCE ANDREW CAME, AND
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE, AND NEVER FORGOT ANYTHING. IF HE NOW INCURRED
EVERYONE IS AFRAID OF HIM, AND THAT MUST PLEASE HIM. HE MUST THINK THAT
EVERYONE KNELT DOWN AND SANG A PRAYER. ALL THESE THINGS WERE REPEATEDLY
EVERYONE KNEW OF THE IMPERIAL DISSATISFACTION WITH HIM. THE PROPRIETIES
EVERYONE MET WITH THE WORDS:
EVERYONE MOVED BACK, AND THE EMPEROR CAME SMILING OUT OF THE DRAWING
EVERYONE QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN. PIERRE FELT PARTICULARLY
EVERYONE TRIED TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE PROJECTILES AS THEY FLEW OVER
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS ILLOGICAL REPLY IS AN IRREFUTABLE
EVERYONE WAITED, SO EMPHATICALLY AND EAGERLY DID HE DEMAND THEIR
EVERYONE WAS PLEASED TO SEE PIERRE, EVERYONE WISHED TO MEET HIM, AND
EVERYONE WITHOUT EXCEPTION AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST VARIATION IN HIS

EVERYTHING BETTER THAN I DO."
EVERYTHING CONVENTIONAL, ARTIFICIAL, AND HUMAN--FOR EVERYTHING THE
EVERYTHING DEPEND ON HER DAUGHTER'S INCLINATION. SHE INVITED NICHOLAS TO
EVERYTHING DONE BY NECESSITY, BY ACCIDENT, OR BY THE WILL OF SUBORDINATE
EVERYTHING EARTHLY AND A STRANGE AND JOYOUS LIGHTNESS OF EXISTENCE.
EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE; FEET, HANDS, NECKS, AND
EVERYTHING FROM SOCIETY AND GIVING NOTHING IN RETURN. YOU HAVE BECOME
EVERYTHING FROM THE TABLE NAPKINS TO THE SILVER, CHINA, AND GLASS BORE
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN ADMIRABLY THOUGHT OUT AS IS USUAL IN DISPOSITIONS,
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN EATEN UP AND THE INHABITANTS HAD ALL FLED--IF ANY
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN FORESEEN, AND THAT IF THE ENEMY WERE REALLY GOING TO

EVERYTHING HE COULD SAY HAD LONG BEEN KNOWN TO HIM, THAT HE WAS WEARY OF
EVERYTHING HERE IS ROTTEN AND THAT AN OVERTHROW IS COMING: I DON'T

HE HAD NO MOTHER.
HE HAD NO PLAN, HE WAS AFRAID OF EVERYTHING, BUT THE PARTIES SNATCHED AT

HIS LOVE AT THE SUKHAREV WATER TOWER. AT THE TIME OF THAT MEETING IT HAD
HIS MAGNANIMOUS PLANS, WAS PACING PATIENTLY UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE
HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR DEROGATES FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF OUR ALLIANCE...
HIS MAJESTY WILL NO DOUBT WISH TO SEE YOU, BUT NOT TODAY. I THANK

HIS MEDICINE HE SOBBED AND SILENTLY KISSED HER HAND. ON HIS LAST DAY,
HIS MERIT.
HIS MILITARY EXPLOITS (PRINCE ANDREW COULD NOT ENDURE THAT SORT OF MAN),

HIS MIND DEVISED REASONS WHY HE SHOULD BE MENTALLY TRANQUIL TOO. THE
HIS MIND THAT THEY WOULD BE FRIENDS.

HIS OWN PLEASURE, CHOSE TO CHAT WITH LIEUTENANT DRUBETSKOY. MORE THAN
HIS OWN SOFTENED AND UPLIFTED SOUL, NOW BLOSSOMING INTO A NEW LIFE.
HIS OWN SOUL--VIVIDLY, PLAINLY, TERRIBLY, AND ALMOST AS A CERTAINTY. AND
HIS OWN SUPPORTER, WOLZOGEN:
HIS OWN WAY, GAVE AN ORDER. NO ONE SAID ANYTHING DEFINITE, BUT THE RUMOR
HIS OWN WORDS.
HIS OWN, GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHY, HE LEAVES ME AND LOCKS ME UP ALONE IN
HIS PARENTS IN WHICH THEY TOLD HIM BRIEFLY OF NATASHA'S ILLNESS AND THE
HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.
HIS PARTICIPATION IN THAT ACTION.
HIS PARTNER WITH A MERRY AND TRIUMPHANT AIR, SUDDENLY STAMPED WITH ONE
HIS PARTNER WITH HIM. HE GLIDED SILENTLY ON ONE FOOT HALF ACROSS THE
HIS PASSION FOR THE EMPEROR HAD COOLED SOMEWHAT IN MOSCOW. BUT STILL, AS
HIS PERSIAN ADVENTURES, AND WAS LEADING A LIFE OF LUXURY, GAMBLING, AND
HIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND AGILITY DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF HIS
HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE.
HIS PISTOL AND, INSTEAD OF FIRING IT, FLUNG IT AT THE FRENCHMAN AND
HIS PISTOL, AND THEN HE FELT WITH SURPRISE THAT OF ALL THE MEN HE KNEW

HIS PROTEGE KUTUZOV, BUT REMAINED SILENT WHEN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WAS
HIS QUARREL WITH HIS SON, HAD HARBORED NASTY SUSPICIONS OF HIM, MAKING
HIS QUESTIONS AS TO WHO HAD WON. AT DAWN NEXT DAY PIERRE WAS APPROACHING

HOPE, INSPIRE US WITH TRUE LOVE ONE FOR ANOTHER, ARM US WITH UNITY OF

HOPED THEY WOULD NOT BE NOTICED.
HOPED TO LEAD HE STILL LIVED THE OLD LIFE, ONLY IN NEW SURROUNDINGS.
HOPED. SHE PRAYED FOR HER BROTHER AS LIVING AND WAS ALWAYS AWAITING NEWS
HOPEFUL BY THE EXPRESSION HE READ ON THE FACES THERE, HE SMILED SADLY
HOPELESS MOVEMENT WITH HIS ARM AND WENT AWAY.
HOPELESS: "THE SOVEREIGNS, MADAME... WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR LOUIS XVII,

HORIZON--FROM THAT DAY THE PROBLEM OF THE VANITY AND USELESSNESS OF ALL
HORIZONTAL WRINKLE BETWEEN HIS BROWS, STOOD IN CIVILIAN DRESS FACING
HORRIFIED BY HER SPIRITUAL BASENESS AND TRYING TO ARRANGE HER THOUGHTS
HORROR OF DEATH, THROUGH PRIVATION, AND THROUGH WHAT HE RECOGNIZED IN
HORROR THAT HAD SEIZED HER WHEN SHE TOUCHED HIM AND CONVINCED HERSELF
HORROR THAT NO BARRIER LAY BETWEEN HIM AND HER.
HORROR, AS BY A PRESENTIMENT.
HORROR-STRUCK. AND YET WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF WAR HE DID NOT ORDER ALL
HORROR-STRUCK. BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT PIERRE'S SACRILEGIOUS WORDS HAD
HORROR.
HORRORS THAT OCCURRED DID NOT STAGGER HIS SOUL. HE BOLDLY TOOK THE
HORSE A LITTLE IN FRONT OF HIS MARSHALS. HE GAZED SILENTLY AT THE HILLS

HORSE; ANOTHER WAS PERCHED UP BEHIND AN HUSSAR WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HIM;
HORSEMAN AND KEEN RIDER TO HOUNDS. BEFORE THE HUNT, BY OLD CUSTOM, THE
HORSEMEN COULD BE DESCRIED. THE OFFICERS SAID THAT EITHER NAPOLEON OR
HORSEMEN DID NOT DISMOUNT AND THAT THE WOLF SHOOK HERSELF AND RAN FOR
HORSEMEN. PIERRE ALSO LOOKED AT THEM, TRYING TO GUESS WHICH OF THE
HORSES AND CALVES WERE STRAYING IN THE ENGLISH PARK. PRINCE ANDREW RODE

HOUR ALONE WITH THE DYING MAN, PASSED OUT, SLIGHTLY ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR
HOUR TO DO SO, AND CAME OUT UPON THE SQUARE WHERE THE STREETS OF THE
HOUR WITH HER WITHOUT ONCE MENTIONING PRINCE ANDREW. "I COULDN'T BEGIN
HOUR, WAS OVER, ROSTOV SAID NOTHING, AND HE SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY IN

HOUSE IN VILNA FROM WHICH ALEXANDER HAD DISPATCHED HIM ON HIS MISSION.

HOUSE WAS CROWDED ON ACCOUNT OF AN APPROACHING NAME DAY), PRINCE ANDREW
HOUSE WAS DOMINATED BY THE SAME FEELING THAT PRINCESS MARY EXPERIENCED
HOUSE WAS ONE TO THANK GOD FOR. WHEN FATHER AND WE WENT OUT MOWING
HOUSE WAS SCRUBBED AND CLEANED ON SATURDAYS; NEITHER SHE NOR THE

HOUSEHOLD BOTH AMONG THEMSELVES AND IN HIS PRESENCE EXPRESSED THEIR
HOUSEHOLD, A COMMON ANXIETY, A SOFTENING OF THE HEART, AND A
HOUSEHOLD, AND THE WHOLE FAMILY MOVED FROM MARYA DMITRIEVNA'S HOUSE TO

HOUSES AND SLAY THEIR FELLOW MEN? WHAT WERE THE CAUSES OF THESE EVENTS?
HOUSES AT ONCE, AND DON'T LET ONE OF YOUR VOICES BE HEARD!"
HOUSES FILLED WITH LUXURIES, HOSPITALS, PRISONS, GOVERNMENT OFFICES,

HOW CAREFULLY AND AT WHAT LENGTH EVERYTHING RELATING TO FORM AND
HOW COULD HE SPEAK LIKE THAT IN HER PRESENCE? THE ONLY EXPLANATION WAS
HOW DOLOKHOV, WHO HAD FULLY RECOVERED HIS FORMER POSITION AFTER THE
HOW FOND THE COUNT IS OF HER."
HOW GOOD IT IS, WHAT MORE DOES ONE NEED?" THOUGHT HE. AND SUDDENLY
HOW HAVE YOU SPENT IT? IN RIOTOUS ORGIES AND DEBAUCHERY, RECEIVING
HOW HE COULD ASK SUCH A QUESTION. PIERRE WENT INTO THE STUDY. PRINCE
HOW HE HAD THAT DAY SEEN KUTUZOV, THE NEWLY CHOSEN CHIEF OF THE
HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF, WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP, AND REALLY IT
HOW HIS ACTIONS MIGHT AFFECT OTHERS OR WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS OR
HOW HORRIFIED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVEN YEARS BEFORE, WHEN HE FIRST

IMAGINE HOW HE WOULD HAVE ARRANGED THINGS IN THIS OR THAT BATTLE--THE

IMPASSIVE FACE OF ORIENTAL TYPE, CAME OUT AFTER THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
IMPASSIVE ON THE FACE OF A LOVED ONE WHO IS DEAD, TAPPING THE LAST ON

IMPATIENT AND SETS TO WORK HIMSELF AND FINDS LETTERS FROM THE EMPEROR
IMPATIENTLY AWAITING HIS NOTICE. THE WOMEN AND GIRLS FLIRTED WITH HIM
IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE ORDER TO MOUNT. HIS FACE, HAVING BEEN BATHED

IMPETUOUSLY TOWARD THE EMBANKMENT TO WATCH THE FIRING. PETYA TOO WOULD

IMPORT OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE LAY IN THE PERSONAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN
IMPORTANCE AND THAT NO TIME MUST BE LOST. HE DID NOT CONSIDER OR ASK
IMPORTANCE OF THE COMING CAMPAIGN.
IMPORTANCE RELATING TO ANDREW BOLKONSKI AND HIS BETROTHED. PIERRE HAD
IMPORTANCE, WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE AT HER RECEPTION. ANNA PAVLOVNA
IMPORTANCE. IN FRONT OF TUCHKOV'S TROOPS WAS SOME HIGH GROUND NOT

IMPORTANT IN ITSELF BUT ONLY AS A PRETEXT FOR DISPUTES AND INTRIGUE.

IMPROVEMENT. HIS SATIRE HAS BEEN LESS BITTER OF LATE, AND THERE WAS A
IMPROVISED BALL, AND THE ROSTOVS STAYED ON. ANATOLE ASKED NATASHA FOR A
IMPRUDENT TO "OVERRESIST" THEM WITHOUT AN ARMED FORCE, AND WOULD IT NOT
IMPULSE.

IN A MERRY MOOD, SITTING DOWN NOW BY ONE, NOW BY ANOTHER, OF THE GUESTS.

IN ACCORD WITH THE ACCEPTED TONE OF THE MOMENT. BUT THE GENERAL OPINION
IN ACTIONS THAT FOLLOWS FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM? THAT IS A
IN ACTUAL LIFE EACH HISTORIC EVENT, EACH HUMAN ACTION, IS VERY CLEARLY
IN ADVANCE OF HIM, AND HE AND HIS SON ARRIVED NEXT DAY.
IN ALL HIS ACTIVITY HE WAS NEVER ONCE UNTRUE TO IT?
IN ALL THESE PLOTTINGS THE SUBJECT OF INTRIGUE WAS GENERALLY THE CONDUCT
IN AMAZEMENT.
IN AMONG SOME RANKS OF INFANTRY MARCHING AHEAD OF HIM. HE TRIED TO PASS
IN AMONG THE PLANTS AND THREW DOWN THE DOLL. "CLOSER, CLOSER!" SHE

IN AND THAT THE COUNTESS WAS BEING ATTENDED BY A CHARLATAN WHO MIGHT
IN ANIMALS, AND WILL GO BACK INTO ANIMALS AGAIN."
IN ANNA PAVLOVNA'S CIRCLE ONLY THOSE FRENCHMEN WERE ADMITTED WHO WERE
IN ANNA PAVLOVNA'S DRAWING ROOM. PIERRE REMOVED HIS FEET FROM THE SOFA.
IN ANOTHER FORM BUT ALONG THE SAME PATH OF REFLECTION THE OTHER SCIENCES
IN ANOTHER THREE YEARS, BY 1820, HE HAD SO MANAGED HIS AFFAIRS THAT HE
IN ANSWER TO QUESTIONS WITH WHICH HE WAS GREETED, THE COURIER MADE A
IN ANSWER TO ROSTOV'S RENEWED QUESTIONS, DENISOV SAID, LAUGHING, THAT HE
IN ANY CASE DISHONORED BY BEING UNABLE TO FULFILL THE GREAT AND
IN ANY OTHER WAY THAT HE HAD THE RIGHT, SINCE HE HAD THE MIGHT.
IN ANYTHING THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET HOLD OF, WERE STANDING IN THE ROAD
IN APRIL THE TROOPS WERE ENLIVENED BY NEWS OF THE EMPEROR'S ARRIVAL,
IN APRIL, ROSTOV WAS ON ORDERLY DUTY. ONE MORNING, BETWEEN SEVEN AND
IN AS FAR AS THAT WAS IN HIS POWER.
IN ATTENDANCE ON HIM TWO OF HIS SERVANTS, TERENTY AND VASKA, WHO HAD
IN AUSTRIA OR PRUSSIA, FOR WE HAVE TO DRAW OUR INFORMATION FROM FRENCH
IN BED THEY WOULD BEGIN TALKING AND GO ON TILL MORNING. THEY SPOKE MOST
IN BOLKONSKI'S EMPHATIC OPINION YET NOT FEELING ABLE FULLY TO CREDIT IT,
IN BOTH CASES HIS PERSONAL ACTIVITY, HAVING NO MORE FORCE THAN THE
IN BRUNN EVERYBODY ATTACHED TO THE COURT WAS PACKING UP, AND THE HEAVY
IN BURNED AND DEVASTATED MOSCOW PIERRE EXPERIENCED ALMOST THE EXTREME
IN CHAPTER 13, VERSE 18, OF THE APOCALYPSE, IT IS SAID:
IN CHESS YOU MAY THINK OVER EACH MOVE AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE AND ARE NOT
IN CHIEF WITH FULL POWERS OVER THE ARMIES AND OVER THE WHOLE REGION
IN CHIEF WOULD BE. THOUGH THE AIDE-DE-CAMP DID NOT KNOW THESE
IN CHIEF'S SUITE. HE WAS IN A STATE OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AND

IN CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIRS OF THE RYAZAN ESTATE OF WHICH HE WAS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BATTLE KUTUZOV RECEIVED A DIAMOND DECORATION,
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DISCOVERY HIS WHOLE MANNER OF LIFE, ALL
IN CONTRAST WITH THE DREAD FELT BY THE INFANTRYMEN PLACED IN SUPPORT,
IN COUNT ARAKCHEEV'S WAITING ROOM.
IN COUPLES AND HE HIMSELF RODE ALONG THE LINE TRYING TO MASTER THE

IN EACH SOLDIER."
IN EARNEST; BUT NATASHA NOTICED THAT HER FATHER WAS FLURRIED ON ENTERING
IN ENEMY HANDS WHILE THE SICK RUSSIANS LEFT BEHIND WERE AMONG THEIR
IN EVERYTHING, SO HE FROWNED AND DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY.
IN EXCUSE OF THAT GARDENER WOULD BE THAT HE WAS VERY ANGRY. BUT NOT EVEN
IN EXTERNAL WAYS PIERRE HAD HARDLY CHANGED AT ALL. IN APPEARANCE HE
IN FACE OF HER SORROW. WITHOUT ANY NEED OF SELF-RESTRAINT, NO WISH TO
IN FACT, AT WHICH HE HAD HAD THE WELL-REMEMBERED PLEASURE OF SEEING HER.
IN FACT, HOWEVER, THOUGH NOW MUCH FARTHER OFF THAN BEFORE, THE ROSTOVS
IN FACT, MURAT, NOW CALLED "KING OF NAPLES." THOUGH IT WAS QUITE
IN FIVE YEARS. HE RECEIVED TEN THOUSAND RUBLES A YEAR, BUT NOW RESOLVED
IN FOLLOWED BY A BLACK ONE, AND EVERYTHING WAS IN CONFUSION; THE BORZOIS
IN FORCE, AND ONLY THE PRESENCE OF VISITORS HINDERED HIS SPEAKING OF IT
IN FORESTALLING THE FRENCH HE WAS TO DELAY THEM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.
IN FORMER YEARS, THAT IS, ENTERTAINING ALMOST THE WHOLE PROVINCE WITH
IN FRANCE, THEN IN ITALY, IN AFRICA, IN PRUSSIA, IN AUSTRIA, IN SPAIN,
IN FRENCH CAPTIVES ALSO. DENISOV THEN RELIEVED HIM FROM DRUDGERY AND
IN FRENCH. "THEY ARE LIKE WOLVES WHOM NOTHING BUT FLESH CAN APPEASE."
IN FRENCH. IT WAS COUNT ROSTOPCHIN. HE TOLD KUTUZOV THAT HE HAD COME
IN FRONT HE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF AN OPEN SPACE WITH A STRIP OF RED CLOTH
IN FRONT OF A LANDOWNER'S HOUSE TO THE LEFT OF THE ROAD STOOD CARRIAGES,
IN FRONT OF HER LEANING ON HIS STICK. "IF YOU THINK SOMETHING MORE IS
IN FRONT OF HIM AND THAT THE ENEMY MUST BE AT LEAST SIX MILES AWAY.
IN FRONT OF HIM SOLDIERS, PROBABLY FRENCHMEN, WERE RUNNING FROM RIGHT
IN FRONT OF HIM.
IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE ALPATYCH FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF

IN FRONT OF THIS POSITION, THEY SAY, A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ON
IN FRONT WERE PUSHING BACK THOSE WHO HAD PRESSED TOO CLOSE TO THE
IN FRONT WITH LANTERNS.
IN FRONT, BEHIND IT THE ARTILLERY, AND BEHIND THAT AGAIN THE INFANTRY.
IN FRONT, WHO HAD SEEN AND HEARD WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BEFORE THEM, ALL
IN FRONT. THERE WERE ABOUT THIRTY OFFICERS, WITH PIERRE AMONG THEM, AND
IN FULL FORCE."
IN FUTURE NOTE DOWN ALL MY ACTIONS.
IN GENERAL AT BALD HILLS THE LITTLE PRINCESS LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR, AND
IN GENERAL I CAN TELL YOU, PAPA, THAT SUCH A HEROIC SPIRIT, THE TRULY
IN GENERAL SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WAS HAPPENING, AND THAT IS ALWAYS
IN GENERAL THE TRAIT OF SPERANSKI'S MENTALITY WHICH STRUCK PRINCE ANDREW
IN GENERAL, FOOD FOR THE MEN. THE YOUNGER ONES OCCUPIED THEMSELVES AS
IN GERMANY. BUT WE, THANK GOD, HAVE NO NEED TO RECOGNIZE HIS GENIUS
IN GIVING AND ACCEPTING BATTLE AT BORODINO, KUTUZOV ACTED INVOLUNTARILY
IN GREAT RUSSIA, WHICH FORMED THE LARGER PART OF HIS PROPERTY, AND LEFT
IN GROUPS; THEY GREETED PIERRE AND SPOKE OF THE TOWN NEWS. THE FOOTMAN
IN HALF AN HOUR ALL WAS AGAIN IN ORDER, ONLY THE SQUARES HAD BECOME GRAY
IN HALF WERE FOR THE MOMENT REPULSED. OUR RESERVE UNITS WERE ABLE TO
IN HAND.
IN HER ABSENCE NICHOLAS ALLOWED HIMSELF TO GIVE HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER A
IN HER ARMS AND HER KERCHIEF TORN FROM HER HEAD, BURST THROUGH THE DOOR
IN HER EYES AND HER LIPS CURVED WITH A STRANGE SMILE.
IN HER FORMER PLACE. IT WAS DARK IN THE ROOM ESPECIALLY WHERE THEY WERE
IN HER GRUFF VOICE: "SO WIVES OF LIVING MEN HAVE STARTED MARRYING
IN HER MALE ATTIRE SHE SEEMED QUITE A DIFFERENT PERSON. LOUISA IVANOVNA
IN HER MIND. THE COUNTESS KNEW THIS, BUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE SHE DID NOT
IN HER RETICULE. "BESIDES, THE TROUSSEAU IS READY, SO THERE IS NOTHING
IN HER ROOM CRYING LIKE A CHILD, BLOWING HER NOSE AND SOBBING. SONYA
IN HER ROOM, MAKING HER EAT AND DRINK, AND TALKING TO HER INCESSANTLY

IN HIS ART, GRASPING HIS PARTNER FIRMLY ROUND HER WAIST, WITH CONFIDENT

IN HIS COFFIN WITH HIS CHIN BOUND UP WITH A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF. AND THE
IN HIS CONSTANT COMINGS AND GOINGS BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPS BECAME CONFUSED
IN HIS CUSTOMARY BASS.
IN HIS HAND WAS APPROACHING THE WINDOW, FROM WHICH THE LIGHT OF THE SKY,
IN HIS HAND. THIS ROOM HAD PROBABLY BEEN A MUSIC ROOM; THERE WAS STILL
IN HIS HAT AND BLACK HAIR CURLING DOWN TO HIS SHOULDERS. HE WORE A RED
IN HIS HEART HIS FORMER LOVE FOR HER. SOMETHING IN HIM HAD SUDDENLY
IN HIS HORSE BEFORE THE EMPEROR.
IN HIS HORSE, SAID TO HIM:
IN HIS LARGE ELONGATED HAND ON BLUE PAPER AS FOLLOWS:
IN HIS LARGE STUDY, THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE HUNG TO THE CEILING WITH
IN HIS LEGS AND SAT UP, SEEKING A FIRM CENTER OF GRAVITY. HE SUCKED AND
IN HIS LETTER TO NAPOLEON, BECAUSE WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC TACT HE FELT
IN HIS LIFE.
IN HIS MIND AN UNSETTLED QUESTION HE ALWAYS TRIED TO STIFLE, ONE ABOUT
IN HIS MIND AS TO WHETHER WHAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN WAS RIGHT OR WRONG.
IN HIS MOVEMENTS, IN HIS WALK, SCARCELY A TRACE WAS LEFT OF HIS FORMER
IN HIS OWN ROOM. AROUND HIM THRONGED MOSCOW'S MOST BRILLIANT YOUNG MEN,
IN HIS OWN SOUL, AND IN GOD, HAD BEEN DESTROYED. HE HAD EXPERIENCED THIS
IN HIS POCKET, FOLDED UP HIS PAPERS, AND CALLED IN ALPATYCH WHO HAD LONG
IN HIS POWER TO REGAIN FAITH IN THE MEANING OF LIFE.
IN HIS PRESENCE INVITED ROSTOPCHIN TO DINNER ON ST. NICHOLAS' DAY, AND
IN HIS SOUL IN CONNECTION WITH THAT TREE. DURING THIS JOURNEY HE, AS
IN HIS SOUL THERE SUDDENLY AROSE SUCH AN UNEXPECTED TURMOIL OF YOUTHFUL
IN HIS STUDY WITH FOLDED HANDS, MOROSE, SALLOW, AND TACITURN.
IN HIS VOICE A SINCERITY AND WEAKNESS PIERRE HAD NEVER OBSERVED IN IT
IN HISTORICAL WORKS ON THE YEAR 1812 FRENCH WRITERS ARE VERY FOND OF
IN HISTORY WE FIND A VERY SIMILAR PROGRESS OF CONVICTION CONCERNING
IN HISTORY, AND THAT HISTORY CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY INTRODUCING A

IN HORSECLOTHS. THEN CAME A CART, AND BEHIND THAT WALKED AN OLD,

IN HOSPITAL. THIS WAS SPERANSKI, SECRETARY OF STATE, REPORTER TO THE

IN HUMAN AFFAIRS, AND THEREFORE HISTORY OUGHT TO GIVE OTHER ANSWERS.
IN HUMAN BEINGS IN SPACE, IN TIME, AND IN DEPENDENCE ON CAUSE FORMS
IN IT AN ORDER ON A RED RIBBON. NAPOLEON, WITHOUT LOOKING, PRESSED TWO
IN IT BY SPRING.
IN IT, BUT EACH TIME SHE LOOKED AT THE PROCESSION HER EYES SOUGHT THAT
IN IT. MOSCOW WHEN OCCUPIED BY THE ENEMY DID NOT REMAIN INTACT LIKE
IN ITS ENTIRETY, BUT RESULTED--MOMENT BY MOMENT, STEP BY STEP, EVENT BY
IN ITS PROGRESS AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN HIS OWN CONCEPTION OF IT TO HER,
IN ITSELF FALSE.
IN JULIE'S SET, AS IN MANY OTHER CIRCLES IN MOSCOW, IT HAD BEEN AGREED
IN JUNE THE BATTLE OF FRIEDLAND WAS FOUGHT, IN WHICH THE PAVLOGRADS DID
IN JUNE, AFTER MANY BALLS AND FETES GIVEN BY THE POLISH MAGNATES, BY THE

IT COMMUNICATED ITSELF ALSO TO PIERRE. THE STORY WAS OF AN OLD MERCHANT

IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE.
IT DASHED, SOME FORWARD AND SOME BACK, DROWNING ONE ANOTHER.
IT DEPENDED ON HIM, VERSER (OU NE PAS VERSER) LE SANG DE SES PEUPLES

IT ESPECIALLY FROM THE LIST OF PRISONERS THE FRENCH OFFICER HAD READ OUT

IT HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO PRINCE ANDREW BEFORE THAT HE WAS ANTIPATHETIC
IT HAD BEEN RAINING SINCE MORNING AND HAD SEEMED AS IF AT ANY MOMENT IT
IT HAD COME OF ITSELF. NOW HE RODE BESIDE ILYIN UNDER THE BIRCH TREES,
IT HAD NOT ENTERED HIS HEAD TO REGRET THAT HE WAS THUS DEPRIVING HIMSELF

IT HAD TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE THEORISTS ARE OFTEN ONE SIDED, AND
IT HAD TO BE DONE. WHY DID THEY GO? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPOSE THAT

IT HE BEGGED PIERRE TO CONTINUE.
IT HURT HER TO THINK THAT WHILE SHE LIVED ONLY IN THE THOUGHT OF HIM, HE

IT IS BEING PUNISHED.

IT MEANS... WHAT DOES IT MEAN?"
IT MEANT. THE SAME QUESTION WAS EXPRESSED IN ALL THE LOOKS THAT MET HIS.

IT MIGHT NOT OCCUR TO HER TO SPEAK OF HIS SHARE IN THE AFFAIR OF THE
IT MIGHT REALLY HAVE BEEN SO? COULD ONE POSSIBLY MAKE OUT AMID ALL THAT
IT MYSELF. SO HE WAS BROUGHT, QUITE BLIND, STRAIGHT TO HER, AND HE GOES
IT NATURALLY SEEMED TO NAPOLEON THAT THE WAR WAS CAUSED BY ENGLAND'S
IT NECESSARY TO HOLD HIS HEAD HIGHER, TO BRACE HIMSELF, AND TO QUESTION
IT NECESSARY TO TELL NATASHA OF PRINCE ANDREW'S WOUND AND OF HIS BEING
IT NEEDS NO CRITICAL EXERTION TO REDUCE UTTERLY TO DUST ANY DEDUCTIONS
IT NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD AND I WOULDN'T DO THAT FOR THEIR GOOD! THAT'S
IT NOTICEABLY NEGLECTED. IN THE ENTRY THERE WAS A SMELL OF FRESH APPLES,
IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT HER AUNT AND THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE HAD INTENTIONS
IT OFF, BUT LET IT DROP AGAIN. THE FIVE MINUTES SPENT WITH HIS EYES
IT OFF. PERHAPS GOD WILL HELP ME TO FIND A WAY TO PREPARE HIM!... ADIEU,

IT RIGHT; NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND," THOUGH HE ENCOURAGED HER BY SAYING
IT SEEMED AS IF FROM SOME WORDS BORIS HAD SPOKEN THAT EVENING ABOUT THE
IT SEEMED AS IF NOTHING IN THAT VOICE COULD BE ALTERED WITHOUT SPOILING
IT SEEMED SO NATURAL TO PIERRE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD LIKE HIM, AND IT
IT SEEMED THAT ALL THESE MEN, NOW THAT THEY HAD STOPPED AMID FIELDS
IT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH IN
IT SEEMED TO DANIEL IRKSOME AND IMPROPER TO BE IN A ROOM AT ALL, BUT TO
IT SEEMED TO HER SHE WAS PENETRATING THE MYSTERY.... BUT AT THE INSTANT
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT NOT ONLY DID EVERYBODY KNOW THAT HER FATE WOULD BE

IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS THINKING OF NOTHING, BUT FAR DOWN AND
IT SEEMED TO HIM, CAUGHT AT HIS FEET. BUT BEFORE HE REACHED THE FOOT
IT SEEMED TO NATASHA THAT EVEN AT THE TIME SHE FIRST SAW PRINCE ANDREW
IT SEEMED TO PIERRE, SUNK IN PROFOUND AND CALM MEDITATION. HIS SERVANT
IT SEEMED TO PRINCESS MARY IN AN UNPLEASANTLY AFFECTED WAY. (THIS WAS
IT SEEMED TO THE COUNT THAT THINGS WERE BEGINNING TO STIR IN THE FRENCH

IT VERY OFTEN HAPPENED THAT IN A MOMENT OF IRRITATION HUSBAND AND WIFE

IT WAS A LETTER FROM HIM--FROM THE MAN SHE LOVED. YES, SHE LOVED HIM, OR
IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE PIERRE COULD FALL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT. HE PACED

IT WAS A SHELL) "EITHER PROVING FATAL AT ONCE OR BEING VERY SLIGHT,"
IT WAS A SWEET, TENDER SADNESS.
IT WAS A SYSTEM--A CONCURRENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
IT WAS A WAR FOR A GREAT CAUSE, THE END OF UNCERTAINTIES AND THE
IT WAS A WAR OF GOOD SENSE, FOR REAL INTERESTS, FOR THE TRANQUILLITY AND
IT WAS A WARM RAINY AUTUMN DAY. THE SKY AND THE HORIZON WERE BOTH
IT WAS A WARM, DARK, AUTUMN NIGHT. IT HAD BEEN RAINING FOR FOUR DAYS.
IT WAS A WARM, GRAY MORNING. PRINCESS MARY STOPPED AT THE PORCH, STILL
IT WAS A WARM, RAINY, AUTUMNAL DAY. THE WIDE EXPANSE THAT OPENED OUT
IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK. THE SUN SHONE SOMEWHAT TO THE LEFT AND
IT WAS ALL THAT THEY COULD DO TO GET THE GUNS UP THE RISE AIDED BY THE
IT WAS ALREADY DARK, AND PIERRE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHETHER THE
IT WAS ALREADY GROWING DUSK WHEN DENISOV, PETYA, AND THE ESAUL RODE UP

IT WAS BECOMING DANGEROUS TO REMAIN IN BOGUCHAROVO. NEWS OF THE APPROACH
IT WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS TO REMAIN AT BALD HILLS, AND
IT WAS BY NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. HALF THE STREET WAS IN SHADOW, THE
IT WAS CLEAR AND FROSTY. ABOVE THE DIRTY, ILL-LIT STREETS, ABOVE THE

IT WAS EMPTY IN THE SENSE THAT A DYING QUEENLESS HIVE IS EMPTY.

IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE PERFORMED HIS DUTY AS A SUBORDINATE WITH EVEN
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS OLD AND STUPID AND THAT THEY, THOUGH NOT IN
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT PRINCE ANDREW WAS NOT INTERESTED IN SUCH ABSTRACT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT PRINCE ANDREW'S IRONICAL TONE TOWARD THE PILGRIMS
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THIS STRANGE, STRONG MAN WAS UNDER THE IRRESISTIBLE
IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE SAME WORDS OR THE SAME ORDER THAT REACHED THE
IT WAS FAR TO THE KREMLIN. THE PORTER, LISTENING IN PERPLEXITY TO THE
IT WAS GETTING DUSK WHEN PRINCE ANDREW AND PIERRE DROVE UP TO THE FRONT
IT WAS GROWING LIGHT, THE SKY WAS CLEARING, ONLY A SINGLE CLOUD LAY IN
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FIRST BECAUSE--AS EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT A THREE-MILE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE BATTLE BEFORE INFORMATION HAD BEEN COLLECTED,
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN THEY BEGAN, HE ENDURED HIS POSITION
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP THEM, SPURRED HIS HORSE AND RODE TO THE RIGHT.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, AND TO HER DELIGHT SHOWED HER A TEXT IN THE GOSPEL
IT WAS IN FRENCH.
IT WAS IN JULY, 1805, AND THE SPEAKER WAS THE WELL-KNOWN ANNA PAVLOVNA
IT WAS JUST THE MOMENT BEFORE A BIG DINNER WHEN THE ASSEMBLED GUESTS,
IT WAS JUST THEN THAT HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIS WIFE, WHO IMPLORED
IT WAS JUST WHEN THE COUNT'S AFFAIRS HAD BECOME SO INVOLVED THAT IT WAS
IT WAS KUTUZOV, WHO HAD BEEN RIDING ROUND THE POSITION AND ON HIS WAY
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY ENTERED THE PALACE AT OLMUTZ
IT WAS LONG BEFORE THEIR CONVERSATION COULD SETTLE ON ANYTHING. THEY
IT WAS LONG SINCE ROSTOV HAD FELT SUCH ENJOYMENT FROM MUSIC AS HE DID
IT WAS LONG SINCE THE ROSTOVS HAD NEWS OF NICHOLAS. NOT TILL
IT WAS NAPOLEON ACCOMPANIED BY TWO AIDES-DE-CAMP. BONAPARTE RIDING
IT WAS NATASHA AND HE LOVED HER.
IT WAS NATASHA, SONYA, AND PETYA, WHO HAD COME TO SEE WHETHER THEY WERE
IT WAS NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK BUT NO ONE WAS YET ASLEEP, WHEN THE
IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIGHT AN UNEXPECTED BATTLE AT SMOLENSK TO SAVE OUR
IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. THE FOG LAY UNBROKEN LIKE A SEA DOWN
IT WAS NO LONGER, AS BEFORE, A DARK, UNSEEN RIVER FLOWING THROUGH THE
IT WAS NOT A BALL, NOR HAD DANCING BEEN ANNOUNCED, BUT EVERYONE KNEW
IT WAS NOT NAPOLEON ALONE WHO HAD EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHTMARE FEELING
IT WAS NOT PRINCE ANDREW WHO WAS MOANING. SHE KNEW PRINCE ANDREW WAS IN
IT WAS NOT THE DRESS, BUT THE FACE AND WHOLE FIGURE OF PRINCESS MARY
IT WAS NOT TILL NEARLY EVENING THAT THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE ESCORT
IT WAS NOW HOT SPRING WEATHER. THE WHOLE FOREST WAS ALREADY CLOTHED IN
IT WAS ON THE VERY FACT OF BEING SO YOUNG THAT PETYA COUNTED FOR SUCCESS
IT WAS ON THIS THAT THE COSSACKS ALL BUSIED THEMSELVES.
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MARCH NIGHTS WHEN WINTER SEEMS TO WISH TO RESUME ITS
IT WAS ONLY A PERSONAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN "GRANDDAD" AND "LONG-COAT" AS
IT WAS ONLY AT HEADQUARTERS THAT THERE WAS DEPRESSION, UNEASINESS, AND
IT WAS ONLY BY THE KEENER WIND THAT MET THEM AND THE JERKS GIVEN BY THE
IT WAS ONLY GRADUALLY DURING HIS CONVALESCENCE THAT PIERRE LOST THE
IT WAS ONLY NOW THAT HE NOTICED WOUNDED MEN STAGGERING ALONG OR BEING
IT WAS PAST ONE O'CLOCK WHEN PIERRE LEFT HIS FRIEND. IT WAS A CLOUDLESS,
IT WAS PLAIN THAT BALASHEV'S PERSONALITY DID NOT INTEREST HIM AT ALL.
IT WAS PLAIN THAT L'AMOUR WHICH THE FRENCHMAN WAS SO FOND OF WAS NOT
IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE RUSSIAN NEST WAS RUINED AND DESTROYED, BUT IN
IT WAS PLAIN THAT THIS "WELL?" REFERRED TO MUCH THAT THEY BOTH
IT WAS PLAIN THAT THIS CADET HAD ALREADY REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A LIFT AND
IT WAS PLAIN THAT WHAT TROUBLED HIM MOST WAS THAT HE HAD GRIEVED ME.
IT WAS PLEASANT AND TOUCHING TO SEE THESE LITTLE GIRLS IN LOVE; BUT
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DRIVE OUT.
IT WAS PRINCE ANDREW. THE FIRST THING HE SAW ON RIDING UP TO THE SPACE
IT WAS PRINCESS MARY WHO GENERALLY BORE THE BRUNT OF HIS FREQUENT FITS
IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THESE SOUNDS. THE DOCTOR THOUGHT
IT WAS RIGHT AND PROPER TO ADDRESS HER HERE IN CHURCH, AND TOLD HER HE
IT WAS RUMORED THAT FREEDOM HAD BEEN GRANTED THEM BUT THE LANDOWNERS HAD
IT WAS RUMORED THAT SAVARY HAD BEEN SENT TO PROPOSE TO ALEXANDER
IT WAS SAID THAT PRINCE VASILI AND THE OLD COUNT HAD TURNED UPON THE

IT WAS SO DARK IN THE FOREST... AND HE HAD SUCH KIND... NO, I CAN'T
IT WAS SO LIGHT THAT HE COULD SEE THE MOONLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE METAL
IT WAS SO PRETENTIOUSLY FALSE AND UNNATURAL THAT SHE FIRST FELT ASHAMED
IT WAS ST. NATALIA'S DAY AND THE NAME DAY OF TWO OF THE ROSTOVS--THE
IT WAS STILL QUITE DARK OUTSIDE. THE RAIN WAS OVER, BUT DROPS WERE STILL
IT WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE ENGLISH CLUB AND SOMEONE NEAR AND DEAR TO HIM
IT WAS THAT FIRST PERIOD OF A CAMPAIGN WHEN TROOPS ARE STILL IN FULL
IT WAS THAT THE PAIN DISTRACTED HIM AND PREVENTED HIS SEEING WHAT HE HAD
IT WAS THE ATTACK IN WHICH HE WAS SAID TO HAVE THROWN SOME ST. GEORGE'S

LETTER AWAY, AND LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE HE DREW TOWARD HIM THE

LIFE MEANWHILE--REAL LIFE, WITH ITS ESSENTIAL INTERESTS OF HEALTH AND
LIFE OF HIS SON ANATOLE, THE SON WHOM THEY WERE PLANNING TO REFORM BY
LIFE OF THE PEOPLES.
LIFE ONE MAY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THOSE IN WHICH SUBSTANCE PREVAILS

LIFE THAT HAD RESTRAINED IT, HE NO LONGER FEARED DEATH AND CEASED TO
LIFE THAT PIERRE HAD NOT THE HEART TO REFUSE, AND SAT DOWN WITH HIM IN
LIFE TO THE LAWS OF REASON.
LIFE WAS CHEAPER BECAUSE IT WAS CIRCUMSCRIBED: THAT MOST EXPENSIVE
LIFE WAS VERY HARD, BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT HELP TORMENTING
LIFE WOULD IT BE FOR SONYA--IF SHE'S A GIRL WITH A HEART? YOUR MOTHER
LIFE'S TURMOIL, FOR IN HIS MIND THE MEMORY OF JOSEPH ALEXEEVICH WAS
LIFE, A THING HE RARELY DID.
LIFE, AND I SEE THAT HOWEVER MUCH AND HOWEVER CAREFULLY I OBSERVE THE
LIFE, AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REGARD THEM MERELY AS BROTHERS IN
LIFE, AND THAT OF THE SEVEN VIRTUES HE LACKED TWO--MORALITY AND THE LOVE

LIKE AN AVALANCHE ON THEIR HEADS FROM TWO SIDES, AND ROUT AND CAPTURE

LIKE THAT, AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT SAVED ME? FREEMASONRY! NO, DON'T SMILE.
LIKE THAT, AND PIERRE WAS RELEASED. NATASHA ON ONE SIDE WAS TALKING WITH

NAPOLEON, STANDING ON THE KNOLL, LOOKED THROUGH A FIELD GLASS, AND IN

NAPOLEON, WITH HIS USUAL ASSURANCE THAT WHATEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD WAS
NAPOLEON--HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP PACE IN WORDS WITH THE RUSH OF THOUGHTS

NATASHA RAN WITH LIGHT FOOTSTEPS TO THE ANTEROOM.
NATASHA REJOINED WITH CONVICTION. "THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL--WELL THEN, IF I
NATASHA REMAINED ALONE AND, FROM THE TIME PRINCESS MARY BEGAN MAKING
NATASHA REMAINED SILENT, FROM SHYNESS MARYA DMITRIEVNA SUPPOSED, BUT
NATASHA ROSE AND CURTSIED TO THE SPLENDID COUNTESS. SHE WAS SO PLEASED
NATASHA ROSTOVA!"
NATASHA SAT DOWN AND, WITHOUT JOINING IN BORIS' CONVERSATION WITH THE
NATASHA SAT ERECT, GAZING WITH A SEARCHING LOOK NOW AT HER FATHER AND
NATASHA SAW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF AND SO SHE BRAVED EVEN
NATASHA SEEMED ROUGH, BUT SHE WAS SO SENSITIVE AND TACTFUL THAT HOWEVER
NATASHA SELDOM OCCURRED TO HIM. IF IT DID IT WAS ONLY AS A PLEASANT
NATASHA SET TO WORK TO EFFECT A RECONCILIATION, AND SO FAR SUCCEEDED
NATASHA SMILED AND WAS ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING.
NATASHA SMILED BASHFULLY.
NATASHA SMILED RAPTUROUSLY.
NATASHA SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS.
NATASHA SOFTLY CLOSED THE DOOR AND WENT WITH SONYA TO THE WINDOW, NOT
NATASHA SPENT MOST OF THE TIME IN HER ROOM BY HERSELF, SITTING HUDDLED
NATASHA SPOKE TO PIERRE ABOUT HER BROTHER'S LIFE AND DOINGS, OF HOW SHE
NATASHA STEPPED BACK TO LOOK AT HERSELF IN THE PIER GLASS. THE DRESS WAS
NATASHA STEPPED UP TO THE WINDOW AND PONDERED.
NATASHA STOPPED ABRUPTLY.
NATASHA STOPPED HIM.
NATASHA STOPPED. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK. IT WAS PLAIN THAT HE WAS
NATASHA SUDDENLY FLUSHED.
NATASHA THREW OFF THE SHAWL FROM HER SHOULDERS, RAN FORWARD TO FACE
NATASHA TO SING.
NATASHA TOLD HER THAT AT FIRST THERE HAD BEEN DANGER FROM HIS FEVERISH
NATASHA TOOK THE FIRST NOTE, HER THROAT SWELLED, HER CHEST ROSE,
NATASHA TURNED HER PRETTY LITTLE HEAD TOWARD THE ELEGANT YOUNG OFFICER
NATASHA UNDERSTOOD THAT) BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THAT
NATASHA UP WARMLY AND TOOK LEAVE OF HER WITH QUITE A NEW TENDERNESS. HE
NATASHA WAS AND JESTED RESOLUTELY AND LOUDLY AT TABLE WITH THE COUNT AND
NATASHA WAS ASHAMED OF DOING NOTHING WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS SO BUSY, AND
NATASHA WAS CALMER BUT NO HAPPIER. SHE NOT MERELY AVOIDED ALL EXTERNAL
NATASHA WAS EVIDENTLY DISMAYED AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT THINK SHE
NATASHA WAS FOREMOST IN SETTING A MERRY HOLIDAY TONE, WHICH, PASSING
NATASHA WAS GAZING AT HER, BUT SEEMED AFRAID AND IN DOUBT WHETHER TO SAY
NATASHA WAS GOING TO HER FIRST GRAND BALL. SHE HAD GOT UP AT EIGHT THAT
NATASHA WAS LISTENING AND CONSIDERING.
NATASHA WAS NOT IN THE ROOM.
NATASHA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO MEET HIM. SHE WAS WEARING A DARK-BLUE
NATASHA WAS SAD AND IRRITABLE ALL THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY WHEN HER MOTHER,
NATASHA WAS SIXTEEN AND IT WAS THE YEAR 1809, THE VERY YEAR TO WHICH SHE
NATASHA WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRAWING ROOM, EMACIATED, WITH
NATASHA WAS SUFFERING FROM, AS NO DISEASE SUFFERED BY A LIVE MAN CAN BE
NATASHA WENT TO THE TABLE AND WITHOUT A MOMENT'S REFLECTION WROTE THAT
NATASHA WENT UP TO HER. "YOU HAVE IMPROVED IN LOOKS AND GROWN MORE
NATASHA WENT UP TO THE MONK FOR HIS BLESSING, AND HE ADVISED HER TO PRAY
NATASHA WERE TALKING ABOUT. SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICES THROUGH
NATASHA WHERE SHE WAS TO STAND--A SPOT WHERE NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY RUN
NATASHA WHOSE RADIANT, HAPPY EXPRESSION--OF WHICH HE WAS CONSCIOUS
NATASHA WITH HIM, WENT TO MOSCOW AT THE END OF JANUARY.
NATASHA WITHOUT KNOWING IT WAS ALL ATTENTION: SHE DID NOT LOSE A WORD,
NATASHA WITHOUT WAITING FOR PRINCESS MARY TO FINISH AGAIN LOOKED
NATASHA WON'T LACK SUITORS. STILL, IT HAS BEEN GOING ON SO LONG, AND
NATASHA WOULD HAVE HAD NO DOUBT AS TO THE GREATNESS OF PIERRE'S IDEA,
NATASHA WOULD MAKE AN EXEMPLARY WIFE AND MOTHER.
NATASHA'S BEAUTY. SHE LOOKED AT NATASHA'S DRESSES AND PRAISED THEM, AS
NATASHA'S CENSURE IT WAS ONLY FOR BUYING TOO MANY AND TOO EXPENSIVE
NATASHA'S FACE AND EYES WOULD HAVE TO TELL HER ALL MORE CLEARLY AND
NATASHA'S FACE HAD TOLD HER. SHE DID NOT SPEAK ANY MORE TO NATASHA OF
NATASHA'S FACE TWITCHED. SHE FROWNED AND LOWERED HER EYES FOR A MOMENT.
NATASHA'S FACE, LEANING OUT OF THE WINDOW, BEAMED WITH QUIZZICAL
NATASHA'S FACE, PREPARED EITHER FOR DESPAIR OR RAPTURE, SUDDENLY
NATASHA'S HAIR.
NATASHA'S HAVING REJECTED HIM) AND AGAIN ASKED NICHOLAS TO RETIRE FROM
NATASHA'S ILLNESS WAS SO SERIOUS THAT, FORTUNATELY FOR HER AND FOR
NATASHA'S LARGE MOUTH WIDENED, MAKING HER LOOK QUITE UGLY, AND SHE BEGAN
NATASHA'S LOOKS, AS EVERYONE TOLD HER, HAD IMPROVED IN THE COUNTRY, AND
NATASHA'S PREDICTION PROVED TRUE. DOLOKHOV, WHO DID NOT USUALLY CARE
NATASHA'S REMARK, BUT SHE DID NOT EXPRESS AGREEMENT IN WORDS.
NATASHA'S REPUTATION.
NATASHA'S ROOM.
NATASHA'S VOICE BROKE. SHE BLUSHED, PRESSED HER CLASPED HANDS ON HER
NATASHA'S WEDDING TO BEZUKHOV, WHICH TOOK PLACE IN 1813, WAS THE LAST
NATASHA'S WOUND HEALED IN THAT WAY. SHE THOUGHT HER LIFE WAS ENDED,
NATASHA, AFRAID THAT HER BROTHER WOULD DO SOMETHING DREADFUL, HAD
NATASHA, AFTER SHE HAD PULLED HIM DOWN TOWARD HER AND COVERED HIS FACE
NATASHA, ALMOST PERPLEXED BY HER FEELINGS. THEY REMAINED SILENT A LONG
NATASHA, AND HE WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT QUIETLY HAPPY. NATASHA, MOTIONLESS
NATASHA, AND HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME THE STORY OF THOSE LAST DAYS OF
NATASHA, ANIMATED AND EXCITED, LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH WIDE-OPEN
NATASHA, BUT DESPITE THAT RESOLUTION HE CALLED AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER
NATASHA, FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF THAT LOOK, SAW AN EXCEPTIONALLY
NATASHA, HALF GROWN UP AND HALF CHILD, WAS NOW CHILDISHLY AMUSING, NOW
NATASHA, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED WHAT THESE SECRET REASONS CAN BE?"
NATASHA, IN THE LIGHT-BLUE DRESSES THEY HAD WORN AT THE THEATER, LOOKING
NATASHA, LEANING ON HER ELBOW, THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE CONSTANTLY
NATASHA, ON THE CHEEK WITH HER LARGE HAND.
NATASHA, PALE AND STERN, WAS SITTING BESIDE MARYA DMITRIEVNA, AND HER
NATASHA, POINTING OUT PRINCE ANDREW. "YOU REMEMBER, HE STAYED A NIGHT
NATASHA, RAISING HER FACE FOR A MOMENT FROM HER MOTHER'S MANTILLA,
NATASHA, SEEING THE IMPRESSION THE NEWS OF HER BROTHER'S WOUND PRODUCED
NATASHA, SHE SAW THE TERRIBLE MORAL SYMPTOMS WHICH TO HER WERE MORE
NATASHA, SHE WAS SEIZED BY A JOYFUL AND SUPERSTITIOUS FEELING THAT GOD
NATASHA, SO SERIOUSLY AND EXCITEDLY THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WHAT SHE
NATASHA, SONYA, MADAME SCHOSS, AND TWO MAIDS GOT INTO NICHOLAS' SLEIGH;
NATASHA, STOPPING SUDDENLY. "I FEEL SO HAPPY!"
NATASHA, THAT WINTER, HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME BEGUN TO SING SERIOUSLY,
NATASHA, THE YOUNG MELYUKOVS' FAVORITE, DISAPPEARED WITH THEM INTO THE
NATASHA, THROWING A CLEAN POCKET HANDKERCHIEF OVER HER HAIR AND HOLDING
NATASHA, WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE IT?..."
NATASHA, WHO FELT HER GLANCE, DID NOT LOOK AT HER. ALL THREE WERE AGAIN
NATASHA, WHO HAD BORNE THE FIRST PERIOD OF SEPARATION FROM HER BETROTHED
NATASHA, WHO HAD COME IN DURING THE CONVERSATION, LOOKED JOYFULLY AT HER
NATASHA, WHO HAD LEFT OFF SINGING BUT HAD NOT YET COME INTO THE DRAWING
NATASHA, WHO HAD LONG EXPECTED TO BE FETCHED TO NURSE HER BABY, NOW
NATASHA, WHO WAS SITTING OPPOSITE TO HIM WITH HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ON HER

NEATNESS, AND ORDER; SO IT WAS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE AND NOT STRANGE THAT
NECESSARY FOR A YOUNG MAN AS THE SOCIETY OF CLEVER WOMEN."
NECESSARY FOR HIM TO GO TO THE COUNT AT ALL, STILL LESS WHY HE HAD TO GO
NECESSARY IN THE ORGANISM OF NATURE, AND THEY ALWAYS EXIST, ALWAYS
NECESSARY MONEY AND WARRANTS, AND HAVING SENT SOME HUSSARS ON IN
NECESSARY TO ENABLE IT TO RETREAT WITHOUT LOSING ITS HEAVY EQUIPMENT.
NECESSARY TO GRASP CLEARLY THE MEANING OF THE FACT THAT, WHILE NOT
NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF, AND WITHOUT EXPERIENCING THE LEAST
NECESSARY TO ORDER AN ATTACK, AND IT WAS FIXED FOR THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER.
NECESSARY TO SET ASIDE HIS FINAL GOAL AND TO SAY TO HIMSELF: "TODAY I
NECESSARY TO TAKE SOME PART IN IT.
NECESSARY, WOULD HIMSELF LEAD THE TROOPS, WHOSE SPIRITS WOULD THEREBY BE
NECESSARY," SAID THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO SPEAKERS, EVIDENTLY IN THE SAME
NECESSITIES OF LIFE. THE FRENCH DID NOT NEED TO BE INFORMED OF THE FACT
NECESSITY IS INCREASED AND DIMINISHED DEPEND ON THREE CONSIDERATIONS:
NECESSITY OF A FUTURE LIFE, BUT THIS: WHEN YOU GO HAND IN HAND WITH
NECESSITY OF SUBMITTING, FOR A TIME, TO THIS NEW ORDER OF THINGS WHICH
NECESSITY THE SMALLER THE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AND VICE VERSA.
NECESSITY TO DOLOKHOV.
NECESSITY TO WHICH HE IS SUBJECT CANNOT BE SOLVED BY COMPARATIVE
NECESSITY, TO ONE WHO KNOWS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE WERE
NECK OF A JUG, AND HAVING SEIZED A HANDFUL OF NUTS WILL NOT OPEN ITS
NECK, AND HER BARE ARMS. NATASHA KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT HE WAS ENRAPTURED
NECK, AND HIS HEAD, THAT HAD BEEN HALF SHAVED, WAS AGAIN COVERED BY
NECK, SHE KISSED HER ON THE THROAT. IN HER BEHAVIOR TO HER MOTHER
NECK. IT SEEMED TO ROSTOV THAT BOGDANICH WAS ONLY PRETENDING NOT TO
NECK. THAT OFFICER DID NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM DOLOKHOV AND AGAIN ASKED
NECKS WHILE THEY CARRIED HIM AND BEGAN WAILING PLAINTIVELY:

NEED OF RE-ESTABLISHING LES BONS PRINCIPES, AND TO THE DIPLOMATISTS OF

NEED, EVEN THE INEVITABILITY, OF ENTERING INTO CONVERSATION WITH THIS
NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE WAS NOT EFFORT OR WORK, OR COURAGE, OR
NEEDED FOR THE DANCE, HAD TEARS IN HER EYES, THOUGH SHE LAUGHED AS SHE
NEEDED FURTHER PROOFS AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO WAIT.
NEEDED IN HIS ANGRY MOOD. ONE OF THE FIRST BULLETS KILLED HIM, AND OTHER
NEEDED TO EXERCISE HER TONGUE AND LUNGS. SHE CRIED AS A CHILD DOES,
NEEDED TO RUN SUCH A SALON, OR BECAUSE THOSE WHO WERE DECEIVED FOUND
NEEDED TO SACRIFICE HERSELF, BUT MADE OTHERS SACRIFICE THEMSELVES FOR

NICHOLAS LOOKED AT HER FACE WITH SURPRISE. IT WAS THE SAME FACE HE HAD
NICHOLAS LOOKED INTO THE RADIANT EYES THAT WERE GAZING AT HIM, AND
NICHOLAS LOWERED HIS LEGS, ROSE, AND TOOK HIS DAUGHTER IN HIS ARMS.
NICHOLAS MIGHT COME IN TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.
NICHOLAS NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD DANIEL UNTIL THE CHESTNUT, BREATHING
NICHOLAS NO LONGER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO SHOW HIS MANLY SUPERIORITY
NICHOLAS OVERTOOK THE FIRST SLEIGH. THEY WERE DRIVING DOWNHILL AND
NICHOLAS PROMISED TO COME AND BLUSHED AGAIN AS HE BOWED. AT THE MENTION
NICHOLAS PUT ALL HIS HORSES TO A GALLOP AND PASSED ZAKHAR. THE HORSES
NICHOLAS PUT DOWN THE BOOK AND LOOKED AT HIS WIFE. THE RADIANT EYES
NICHOLAS REMAINED SILENT. IT COMFORTED HIM TO HEAR THESE ARGUMENTS.
NICHOLAS ROSTOV EXPERIENCED THIS BLISSFUL CONDITION TO THE FULL WHEN,
NICHOLAS ROSTOV MEANWHILE REMAINED AT HIS POST, WAITING FOR THE WOLF. BY

NICHOLAS SAID NOTHING. HE FLUSHED CRIMSON, LEFT HER SIDE, AND PACED UP
NICHOLAS SANG A SONG HE HAD JUST LEARNED:

NICHOLAS THAT THIS WAS ALL HE COULD LET HIM HAVE TILL MAY, AND ASKED HIM
NICHOLAS THE FLATTERING THINGS PRINCESS MARY SAID OF HIM AND VICE
NICHOLAS TO BE SAYING.
NICHOLAS TOO WAS GREATLY PLEASED BY "UNCLE'S" PLAYING, AND "UNCLE"

NICHOLAS WITH A SMILE. "YOU AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING OF ONE ANOTHER
NICHOLAS! I AM HORRID SOMETIMES, BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO BE HAPPY WHILE
NICHOLAS' LETTER IN WHICH HE MENTIONED PRINCESS MARY HAD ELICITED, IN
NICHOLAS' LETTER WAS READ OVER HUNDREDS OF TIMES, AND THOSE WHO WERE
NICHOLAS' POSITION BECAME WORSE AND WORSE. THE IDEA OF PUTTING SOMETHING

NO LONGER A YOUNG DIPLOMAT, AS HE HAD ENTERED THE SERVICE AT THE AGE
NO LONGER AROUSED IN HIM THE FORMER FEELING OF CAREFUL PITY, AN
NO LONGER IN GENERAL USE. PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED THE STORY OF SUVOROV
NO LONGER IN THE UNPLEASANTLY HOSTILE TONE OF NICHOLAS' LAST REMARK.
NO LONGER LOOKED AT THE FRENCH BUT PAID ATTENTION TO THE SIGHT-SEERS AND
NO LONGER WAS AND AT THAT MOMENT CONSIDERED THEMSELVES HAPPY.

NO ONE REPLIED AND PRINCESS MARY, LOOKING ROUND AT THE CROWD, FOUND THAT
NO ONE REPLIED TO HIS REMARKS.
NO ONE REPLIED TO THIS REMARK AND FOR SOME TIME THEY ALL GAZED SILENTLY
NO ONE REPLIED. NATASHA ROSE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY, CROSSED HERSELF, AND
NO ONE SAW HER. ROSTOV, HOLDING HIS BREATH, LOOKED ROUND AT THE BORZOIS.

NOT PROVE THAT I COULD HAVE ABSTAINED FROM LIFTING IT THEN. AND SINCE I
NOT PROVE THAT NAPOLEON CAUSED IT TO RETREAT, BUT THAT THE FORCES WHICH

NOT QUITE SEE IT; MORE PARTICULARLY AS IT IS HE AND HIS CORPS WHO ARE
NOT READY. HE DID NOT WISH TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THE PLEASURE OF GIVING HIM
NOT REFRAIN FROM ASKING WHAT WAS THE MATTER, SO STRANGELY DISMAL AND
NOT REFRAIN FROM GRUMBLING AT AND WORRYING SONYA, OFTEN PULLING HER
NOT REFUSE, AND PROMISED TO COME.
NOT REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS THAT PEOPLE SAY. HE LOOKED AT HER FACE. SHE
NOT RESPONDED TO HIS GREETING. WHEN THE EMPEROR'S HEALTH WAS DRUNK,
NOT REST HERE?"
NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF. HE TOUCHED HIS HORSE, GAVE THE WORD OF COMMAND,
NOT RIGHT!' OUR LUCK IS LIKE WATER IN A DRAGNET: YOU PULL AT IT AND IT
NOT RIGHT, MONSIEUR PIERRE?" SAID HE, GROWING ANIMATED. "ANOTHER GLASS?"
NOT RIGHT."
NOT SACRIFICE A SINGLE RUSSIAN FOR TEN FRENCHMEN.
NOT SATISFIED, LET US HAVE A BUNT OF OUR OWN. THAT'S ALL WIGHT. JE SUIS
NOT SAY.
NOT SEE HERSELF. SHE LISTENED TO THE SOUNDS IN THE HALL. WHEN SHE SAW
NOT SEE HIM. SHE ONLY FELT A SOFT HAND TAKING HERS FIRMLY, AND SHE
NOT SEE TEN PACES AHEAD. BUSHES LOOKED LIKE GIGANTIC TREES AND LEVEL
NOT SEE WHAT SHE OUGHT TO SACRIFICE, OR FOR WHOM. SHE COULD NOT HELP
NOT SEEM TO HIM SLOWER THAN AN AWAKENING FROM SLEEP COMPARED TO THE
NOT SEEN HER WITH PRINCE ANDREW. IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS
NOT SENT AWAY WITH THE OTHER PRISONERS. PETYA HAD HEARD IN THE ARMY MANY
NOT SHE BUT HE WAS SO UNUSUALLY BEAUTIFUL, AND THAT THAT WAS WHY THEY
NOT SLEEP.
NOT SMILE WITH PLEASURE OR AFFECTION FOR HIS SON, BUT WITH QUIET, GENTLE
NOT SO BRIGHT AND POETIC AS THE FORMER, WAS STRONGER AND MORE SERIOUS.
NOT SO MAD AS I SEEMED. ON THE CONTRARY I WAS THEN WISER AND HAD
NOT STAND HIS TERRIBLE PHYSICAL LABOR BUT SHOULD DIE OF IT IN A WEEK, SO
NOT STEPPING SIMPLY ON THE RESOUNDING PARQUET BUT TREADING WITH EACH
NOT STIFFEN WHILE OPEN, AND WITH ANOTHER HANDKERCHIEF TIED TOGETHER THE
NOT STIR, FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIS UNINTENTIONAL PRESENCE.
NOT STOP AT ANY ONE OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE KUTUZOV DID NOT WISH TO
NOT SUBMIT TO SPERANSKI'S OPINIONS ENTIRELY. EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT AND
NOT SUPPOSE ME TO BE SO BAD. WITH MY WHOLE SOUL I WISH TO BE WHAT YOU
NOT SURVIVE THE FALL OF MOSCOW, AND NOW WROTE FRENCH VERSES IN ALBUMS
NOT TAKE PART, AND AFTER THAT AN ARMISTICE WAS PROCLAIMED. ROSTOV, WHO
NOT TALK, BUT ACT. THE SPOKEN WORD IS SILVER BUT THE UNSPOKEN IS GOLDEN.
NOT THE FRENCH WERE RUNNING AFTER THEM, BUT NOT DARING TO.
NOT THE LEAST FEELING OF FEAR. HE WAS FEARLESS, NOT BECAUSE HE HAD GROWN
NOT THE OUTCOME OF CUNNING CALCULATIONS, BUT OF A FEELING THAT LAY IN
NOT THE SAME, NOT AT ALL THE SAME, AS WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN HIS FORMER

NOT UNDERSTAND. ONE WAS TALLER THAN THE OTHER; HE WORE AN OFFICER'S HAT
NOT UNDRESSED DURING THE FIRST THREE NIGHTS, IN ORDER TO BE READY TO

NOT VENTURE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS, AND SHUT THE DOOR AGAIN, NOW SITTING

NOT VISIBLE AT ALL. ALL THAT STRUCK THE EYE WAS A STRONG, HANDSOME, AND

NOWADAYS? WHY, IF HE WAS SO JEALOUS, AS I SEE THINGS HE SHOULD HAVE
NOWHERE ELSE FOR THE FAMILY TO TALK BUT HERE AT THE BALL. SHE DID NOT
NOWHERE ENCOUNTERING THE ENEMY. ON THE CONTRARY, THE SOLDIERS BECAME
NOWHERE, AND WERE ENDING THEIR DAYS LEISURELY; WHEN HE SAW THOSE OLD
NUISANCE TO EVERYBODY, THAT SNUB-NOSED PETYA WITH HIS MERRY BLACK EYES
NUMBER IS 64-6221541.  ITS 501(C)(3) LETTER IS POSTED AT
NUMBER OF THOSE CONDITIONS IS AS INFINITE AS THE INFINITY OF SPACE. AND
NUMBER ONE JUMPED BRISKLY ASIDE. THE GUN RANG OUT WITH A DEAFENING
NUMBER, EVER INCREASING AND INCREASING, EXCEEDED WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN
NUMBER--AS A RESULT OF WHICH THE SUPERIORITY HAD PASSED TO THE RUSSIAN
NUMBERS, HE WAS AGAIN ALLOTTED HIS OLD SQUADRON.
NUMEROUS THESE DETACHMENTS BECAME.
NURSE AND NURSE SAVISHNA IN THE LATE PRINCESS' ROOMS AND PRINCESS MARY
NURSE HAD TOLD HIM LONG AGO: THAT GOD IS HERE AND EVERYWHERE. IN HIS
NURSE IS UNNATURAL AND HARMFUL. WHEN HER NEXT BABY WAS BORN, DESPITE
NURSE SAVISHNA, KNITTING IN HAND, WAS TELLING IN LOW TONES, SCARCELY
NURSE'S FRENCH, AT WHICH HE AND BORIS USED TO LAUGH LONG AGO.
NURSE, AS SHE STOOD IN ONE OF THE DOORWAYS.
NURSE, OR WITH "GOD'S FOLK" WHO SOMETIMES CAME BY THE BACK DOOR TO SEE
NURSE, PRASKOVYA SAVISHNA, WHO HARDLY EVER CAME TO THAT ROOM AS THE OLD
NURSERY, BUT SONYA WAS NOT THERE EITHER. NATASHA CONCLUDED THAT SHE MUST
NURSES WHO KNIT STOCKINGS, AND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING SOOTHING IN
NURSING OF HER CHILDREN, AND SHARING EVERY MOMENT OF HER HUSBAND'S LIFE,
NUTS. ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE JOKING WITH THE GIRLS,
O'CLOCK ALL HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO DUE ORDER. THE RANKS WERE DRAWN UP ON

OBEDIENTLY AND WAS ABOUT TO GO BUT AT THAT INSTANT THERE CAME INTO

OBJECT OF ALL THESE WORDS AND ALL THIS TROUBLE WAS, AFTER CONVERTING HER
OBJECT THAT LAY ON THE SALVER. IT WAS THE ORDER OF ST. GEORGE OF THE

OBLIGATION, ASSUMING AN AIR OF MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN HE HAD DONE

OBLIGATIONS."
OBLIGED THE HISTORIANS, AFTER THEY HAD APPARENTLY REJECTED THE DIVINE
OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT SOME OF THESE TRANSFERS ARE NOT NORMAL DELEGATIONS
OBLIGED TO TAKE PART IN USELESS AGGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS. THE LESSON OF THE
OBLIQUE MOVEMENTS DEDUCED BY HIM FROM THE HISTORY OF FREDERICK THE
OBOLENSKI'S COSSACKS AND WENT TO BELAYA TSERKOV WHERE THE REGIMENT IS
OBSCURE RUMORS WERE ALWAYS CURRENT AMONG THEM: AT ONE TIME A RUMOR THAT
OBSCURE, IMPALPABLE, AND GENERAL ABSTRACTION WHICH CAN COVER ALL
OBSCURITY TO THE COMMON TASK. WHATEVER QUESTION AROSE, A SWARM OF THESE
OBSCURITY, POWER AND SUBORDINATION, STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS, HEALTH AND
OBSERVATION SHE HAD OF LIFE, THE GREATER WAS HER WONDER AT THE
OBSERVATION, AND EXPERIENCE, BUT HAD HE POSSESSED ALL THE FACULTIES HE

OBSERVED IN HER AT THIS TIME. HE WAS, HOWEVER, PREPARING TO GO AWAY AND
OBSERVED THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND HIM.

OBSERVING AND THE LESS COMPLEX THE CHARACTER AND MIND OF THE MAN IN
OBSTINACY," SAID KIRSTEN.
OBSTINATE. I TRIED THREATS, BUT HE ONLY GREW ANGRIER. THEN I TOOK THE
OBSTINATELY TACITURN ROSTOV, SAYING THAT THE LATTER HAD PROBABLY COME TO
OBTAINED ALL THIS? CHIEFLY BY KNOWING HOW TO CHOOSE MY AQUAINTANCES. IT
OBTAINED COULD NOT BE DELIVERED IN TIME. IF NEWS WAS RECEIVED ONE DAY
OBTAINED HIS CAPTAINCY DURING THE CAMPAIGN, HAD GAINED THE CONFIDENCE OF
OBTAINED HIS LEAVE. HIS HUSSAR COMRADES--NOT ONLY THOSE OF HIS OWN
OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON, ASKING HIM TO TAKE
OBTAINED TWO DECORATIONS FOR AUSTERLITZ.
OBTUSENESS TO EVERYTHING OTHER THAN HIMSELF DISARMED PIERRE.
OBVIOUS FALSEHOOD, AND THAT BALASHEV STILL STOOD SILENTLY BEFORE HIM IN
OBVIOUS, AND YET NAPOLEON OFFERED AND KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THAT BATTLE.
OCCASION HAD BEEN DRIVEN BACK BY GRAPESHOT FROM THE FOUR ISOLATED GUNS
OCCASION, YET BOTH WOULD BE RIGHT. HE LIKED TO TALK AND HE TALKED WELL,
OCCASIONALLY DREW IT DOWN TO MEET THE LOWER LIP. AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE
OCCASIONALLY GLANCED AT HER FACE AS HE EXPLAINED HIS OPINION ON THE
OCCASIONALLY HE STOPPED, LISTENED TO THE FIRING, AND GAZED INTENTLY AT
OCCASIONALLY PLUCKING LEAVES FROM A BRANCH THAT MET HIS HAND, SOMETIMES
OCCASIONALLY WENT WITHIN MUSKET RANGE, MADE THEIR OWN ARRANGEMENTS
OCCASIONALLY.
OCCASIONED BY THE SAUSAGE EATERS.
OCCASIONED THE EMPEROR.
OCCASIONS, AND OF HIS ORDERS DURING THE BATTLE NOT BEING AS GOOD AS
OCCASIONS--THAT HE LOVED HER AND HAD NEVER LOVED ANY OTHER WOMAN MORE
OCCUPATION OF MOSCOW BY THE ENEMY AND ITS DESTRUCTION BY FIRE, THE MOST
OCCUPATION OF MOSCOW WOULD NOT BE THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, FOR HE HAD
OCCUPATION, CAME UP TO HER FOR A MOMENT AND MADE HASTE TO GO AWAY,
OCCUPATION.
OCCUPATION. IT WAS TOO DREADFUL TO BE UNDER THE BURDEN OF THESE
OCCUPATIONS AS HINDRANCES TO LIFE, AND CONSIDERED THAT THEY WERE ALL
OCCUPATIONS, THE CHILDREN'S UPBRINGING, WERE ALL SELECTED NOT MERELY
OCCUPIED BY BORIS AND ZHILINSKI.
OCCUPIED BY THE EMPERORS AND THEIR RETINUES.
OCCUPIED BY THE ENEMY, AND THEREBY AVERTING DANGER FROM TULA AND OTHER
OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH, WITH LILAC BUSHES STILL SHOWING DARK GREEN
OCCUPIED BY THEM.
OCCUPIED BY TROOPS. BENNIGSEN LOUDLY CRITICIZED THIS MISTAKE, SAYING
OCCUPIED NEAR KALUGA.
OCCUPIED NOT WITH WHAT WAS BEFORE HIS EYES BUT WITH SOMETHING SPECIAL
OCCUPIED ONE OF THE HIGHEST POSTS IN THE EMPIRE. IN VILNA SHE HAD FORMED
OCCUPIED THAT REGION, AND THE RUSSIANS--THE UNINJURED AND SLIGHTLY
OCCUPIED WITH EVENING PARTIES, DINNERS, LUNCHES, AND BALLS, GIVING HIM
OCCUPIED. HE WAS HIMSELF ALWAYS OCCUPIED: WRITING HIS MEMOIRS, SOLVING
OCCUPIED. THE GERMAN WHO KNEW LITTLE FRENCH, ANSWERED THE TWO FIRST
OCCUPIES THE PLACE?" ASKED PRINCE ANDREW.
OCCUPY A POSITION HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN, BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMAND
OCCUPY ALL THE HOUSES ONE AFTER ANOTHER. PIERRE, WHO KNEW GERMAN,
OCCUPY IS A STRONG ONE, AND WHILE THEY ARE MARCHING TO GO ROUND ME ON
OCCUPYING VIENNA, THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. NAPOLEON'S
OCCURRED AND THE SOVEREIGNS ONCE AGAIN ALL BEGAN TO OPPRESS THEIR
OCCURRED BEFORE OUR FATHERS' EYES, AND FOR THEM IT WAS A QUESTION OF THE
OCCURRED TO HIM. ON THE CONTRARY, HE BECAME MORE AND MORE ELATED. IT
OCCURRED TO HIS REGIMENT, BUT IN REALITY HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW WHAT
OCCURRED TO NONE OF THEM THAT IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AND TIME TO GO TO
OCCURRED, PRINCESS MARY AND NATASHA WERE PRESENT.
OCCURRED.
OCCURRED. "ANY POLICE OFFICER WOULD HAVE DONE AS MUCH! IF WE HAD HAD
OCCURRENCES QUITE APART FROM, AND UNCONNECTED WITH, THE BATTLE. IT WAS

OCCURS. THE ALLIES DETEST NAPOLEON WHOM THEY REGARD AS THE CAUSE OF
OCCURS: A BACKWASH WHICH SERVES TO SOLVE THE APPARENTLY INSUPERABLE

OF "AUTHOR! AUTHOR!" WERE HEARD IN THE CROWD), SAID THAT "HELL MUST BE
OF "THE HEART OF RUSSIA." NOT ONLY DID IT SEEM TO HIM (AS TO ALL

OF 1812, HAS NOT EXPERIENCED AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF REGRET,
OF A CONTEMPORARY, THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN TO ME.
OF A CONVERSATION THAT WAS STARTED ABOUT NAPOLEON'S SPANISH AFFAIRS,
OF A DOCTOR TO WHOM AN OLD WIFE WISHES TO EXPLAIN THE TREATMENT OF A
OF A FORCE COMPELLING MEN TO DIRECT THEIR ACTIVITY TOWARD A CERTAIN END.
OF A FOURTH OPINION THE MOST CONSPICUOUS REPRESENTATIVE WAS THE
OF A GREAT MAN EXECUTING A DUC--OR EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WHO--IS INNOCENT
OF A HANDSOME YOUTH AT SONYA AND THE YOUNG LADY VISITOR.
OF A HELEN. "BUT NO DOUBT IT ALWAYS IS AND MUST BE SO!" HE CONSOLED

OF A LOCOMOTIVE TO CLEAR THE SNOW FROM THE RAILS IN FRONT: THEY CLEAR
OF A MAN'S FOOTSTEP, AND THEN HER FACE RESUMED ITS COLD AND MALEVOLENT
OF A MILE WAS STOPPED ON THE HIGHROAD. ROSTOV SAW THE COSSACKS AND THEN
OF A NEW GALLERY OR CONSERVATORY, THE INAUGURATION OF A PRIVATE THEATER
OF A PRAYER, BUT SHE COULD NOT PRAY. SHE FELT THAT A DIFFERENT WORLD HAD
OF A RULING PRINCE, IN A CROWN--AN ALLEGED DESCENDANT OF RURIK AND
OF A SACK, DASHED GAILY ACROSS THE BROOK TOWARD THE CAMP.
OF A SATIRIST, AND LAUGH IRONICALLY AT HIS OPPONENTS; NOW GROW SEVERELY

OF AGREEMENT WITH WHICH FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO
OF ALL DIFFERENCES OF FAITH, UNDERSTOOD THE FULL IMPORTANCE OF THE RITE
OF ALL EXCEPT PFUEL HAD ONE COMMON TRAIT THAT HAD NOT BEEN NOTICEABLE
OF ALL OUR LEVIES, BOTH THOSE NOW BARRING THE ENEMY'S PATH AND THOSE
OF ALL SHE DID SUDDENLY SET TO WORK TOO. AT FIRST HER INTERVENTION IN
OF ALL THAT MASS OF HUGE AND HANDSOME MEN, OF ALL THOSE BRILLIANT,
OF ALL THE AFFAIRS AWAITING PIERRE THAT DAY THE SORTING OF JOSEPH
OF ALL THE COMBINATIONS IN WHICH MEN UNITE FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION ONE OF
OF ALL THESE MEN PRINCE ANDREW SYMPATHIZED MOST WITH PFUEL, ANGRY,

OF ALL THIS, THE SOLDIERS OF DENISOV'S SQUADRON FED CHIEFLY ON "MASHKA'S

OF ALL WORLDLY THINGS, AND TO THEM SHE SHOWED HER ALBUMS FILLED WITH

OF ALLEGIANCE AND DUTY... I AM SORRY YOU WEREN'T THERE. THEY ALL FELL
OF AMUSEMENT WHICH SOMEONE FOR SOME REASON HAD TO PROVIDE FOR HIM.
OF AN ATTACK SPREAD THROUGH THE SQUADRON. THE COMMAND TO FORM UP RANG
OF AN EVENT; BUT HOW A BOOK, LE CONTRAT SOCIAL, HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING
OF AN UPRISING IN THE CITY? THE INHABITANTS WERE LEAVING IT AND THE
OF ANOTHER'S HEALTH. ROSTOV WENT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND LOOKING
OF ANTIQUITY HAD BEEN PERFORMED BY GENERAL RAEVSKI. HE RECOUNTED HOW
OF ANY WORD OR DEED TAKEN SEPARATELY.

OF THE RULERS OF FRANCE, WHO SUBMIT TO HIM; CHANCE FORMS THE CHARACTER
OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY, SENT ARMY CORPS OUT ALONG THE DIFFERENT ROADS, AND

PIERRE ROSE TO HELP HIM.
PIERRE ROSE, RUBBED HIS EYES, AND SEEING THE PISTOL WITH AN ENGRAVED
PIERRE RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD.
PIERRE RUSHED TO THE WING, BUT THE HEAT WAS SO GREAT THAT HE

RADIANT LOOK WHICH CAUSED THE PLAINNESS OF HER FACE TO BE FORGOTTEN.
RADIANTLY HAPPY ALL THAT SAINT'S DAY, SUDDENLY CHANGED: HER EYES BECAME
RADIANTLY ON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE. PIERRE GAZED AT HER WITH RAPTUROUS,
RAEVSKI HAD LED HIS TWO SONS ONTO THE DAM UNDER TERRIFIC FIRE AND HAD
RAEVSKI REPORTED THAT THE TROOPS WERE FIRMLY HOLDING THEIR GROUND AND

RAISED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH.

RAISING HIS ARM, AND FELL ON HIS CHEST. SEVERAL OFFICERS RAN UP TO HIM.
RAISING HIS EYES AT THE OPENING OF THE DOOR AND THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS.
RAISING HIS SOFT FOOT BACKWARDS, BOWING HIS PERSPIRING HEAD, SMILING
RAISING HIS VOICE AT THE CARD TABLE, AND THE SAMOVAR AND THE TEA CAKES;

RAISING WORTHY MEN FROM THE DUST AND ATTACHING THEM TO OUR BROTHERHOOD.
RAISINS, FINE ONES; YOU KNOW, SEEDLESS ONES. WE HAVE A NEW SUTLER AND

RAN AHEAD ON TIPTOE AND KNOCKED AT A DOOR.
RAN AWAY FROM HER AND SHE CAME GALLOPING AFTER HIM. HE DINED WITH ME ON

RAN BAREFOOT TO HER OWN ROOM.

RAN RAPIDLY OVER THE WIDE SPACE, BUT HE ONLY SAW THAT THE HITHERTO
RAN TO CATCH UP HIS LINE AND, FALLING INTO STEP WITH A HOP, LOOKED BACK
RAN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TOWARD THE BUSHES. HE DID NOT NOW RUN WITH THE

RAPID STEPS TO THE VILLAGE.
RAPIDITY THAT HE HAD NOT TIME TO FINISH ARRANGING THE SURPRISE.
RAPIDITY. HE AGAIN VIVIDLY RECALLED THE DETAILS OF THE BATTLE, NO LONGER

REINSTATING THE FIRST CONDITION OMITTED, THAT OF TIME, WE SEE THAT NO

REMAINED, THEY WERE WORSE THAN BEGGARS AND NOTHING MORE COULD BE TAKEN
REMAINED. THE PRISONERS WERE MORE BURDENSOME TO THE ESCORT THAN EVEN THE
REMAINING ALONE IN THE LITTLE ROOM, HE WALKED UP AND DOWN FOR A LONG
REMAINING IN MOSCOW, AND ONLY AWAITED THE TERMINATION OF DENISOV'S
REMAINS OF SHEDS, CHAIRS, TABLES, WHEELS, TUBS, AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY

ROSTOPCHIN FELT THIS, AND IT WAS THIS WHICH EXASPERATED HIM.
ROSTOPCHIN HAD REPLIED THAT HE COULD NOT COME:

ROSTOV AND THE ASSISTANT WENT INTO THE DARK CORRIDOR. THE SMELL WAS SO
ROSTOV ANTICIPATED HIS HORSE'S MOVEMENTS AND BECAME MORE AND MORE

ROSTOV BECAME THOUGHTFUL.
ROSTOV BY HIS TITLE, AS IF IN RECOGNITION OF HIS CONFESSION. "GO AND
ROSTOV COMING UPSTAIRS.
ROSTOV CONSIDERED, AND THEN WENT IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THEY SAID HE
ROSTOV COULD ALREADY SEE THEIR FACES AND HEARD THE COMMAND: "CHARGE!"
ROSTOV DESCRIBED DENISOV'S APPEARANCE.
ROSTOV DID NOT KNOW OR REMEMBER HOW HE RAN TO HIS PLACE AND MOUNTED.
ROSTOV DID NOT LISTEN TO THE SOLDIER. HE LOOKED AT THE SNOWFLAKES
ROSTOV DID NOT SPEAK.
ROSTOV DID NOT THINK WHAT THIS CALL FOR STRETCHERS MEANT; HE RAN ON,
ROSTOV DISMOUNTED, GAVE HIS HORSE TO THE ORDERLY, AND FOLLOWED ALPATYCH

ROSTOV SPURRED HIS HORSE, CALLED TO SERGEANT FEDCHENKO AND TWO OTHER
ROSTOV STAKED FIVE RUBLES ON A CARD AND LOST, STAKED AGAIN, AND AGAIN
ROSTOV STILL HAD THE SAME INDEFINITE FEELING, AS OF SHAME.
ROSTOV STOOD AT THAT CORNER FOR A LONG TIME, WATCHING THE FEAST FROM A

ROSTOV TOOK THE MONEY, AVOIDING TELYANIN'S EYES, AND WENT OUT OF THE
ROSTOV TOOK THE PURSE IN HIS HAND, EXAMINED IT AND THE MONEY IN IT, AND
ROSTOV TURNED AND WAS ABOUT TO GO, BUT THE MAN IN THE BRACES STOPPED
ROSTOV TURNED HIS HORSE AND GALLOPED BACK. FOUR MORE REPORTS FOLLOWED

ROSTOV WIPING HIS MUDDY HANDS ON HIS BREECHES LOOKED AT HIS ENEMY AND

ROSTOV'S HORSE WAS ALSO GETTING RESTIVE: IT PAWED THE FROZEN GROUND,
ROSTOV'S INQUIRY AS TO HOW THE MATTER STOOD, HE AT ONCE PRODUCED FROM
ROSTOV'S RAPID, FIRM STEPS AND RESOLUTE, FROWNING FACE.
ROSTOV'S SHARE IN DOLOKHOV'S DUEL WITH BEZUKHOV WAS HUSHED UP BY THE
ROSTOV'S SOUL (IT SEEMED TO ROSTOV THAT HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING), AT
ROSTOV'S THOUGHT.
ROSTOV'S THOUGHTS, AS IS USUAL IN SUCH CASES, WERE BEHIND HIM, WITH THE
ROSTOV, "YOU'LL WIN IT BACK ALL THE SOONER. I LOSE TO THE OTHERS BUT WIN
ROSTOV, ABSORBED BY HIS RELATIONS WITH BOGDANICH, HAD PAUSED ON THE

ROSTOV, HE STOPPED SHORT AND FROWNED.
ROSTOV, HIS EYES AVOIDING DENISOV, BEGAN BUTTONING HIS COAT, BUCKLED ON
ROSTOV, IN COMMON WITH THE WHOLE ARMY FROM WHICH HE CAME, WAS FAR
ROSTOV, IN DISMAY, BEGAN JUSTIFYING HIMSELF, BUT SEEING THE KINDLY,
ROSTOV, KNITTING HIS BROWS, LEFT THE ROOM WITH ANOTHER LOW BOW.
ROSTOV, RUBBING HIS EYES THAT SEEMED GLUED TOGETHER, RAISED HIS
ROSTOV, SMOKING HIS PIPE AND TURNING HIS HEAD ABOUT AS THE WATER
ROSTOV, STANDING IN THE FRONT LINES OF KUTUZOV'S ARMY WHICH THE TSAR
ROSTOV, STILL LOOKING ROUND TOWARD THE FIRES AND THE SHOUTS, RODE WITH
ROSTOV, WHO HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN DENISOV, NOT WISHING ANYONE TO
ROSTOV, WHO HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE ALEXANDER

ROSTOV, WITH HIS KEEN SPORTSMAN'S EYE, WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO CATCH
ROSTOV, WITHOUT RETURNING HOME, TOOK A HORSE AND RODE THERE. THERE WAS
ROSTOV, WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR HIM OUT, TOUCHED HIS HORSE, GALLOPED TO
ROSTOV.

ROSTOVS, AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN THEIR PRESENCE EVEN TO MENTION
ROSTOVS, AND THE PARTY BECAME UNQUESTIONABLY EXACTLY LIKE ALL OTHER
ROSTOVS. HE HAD BEEN IN MOSCOW SEVERAL TIMES, AND HAD PASSED NEAR
ROSTOVS. NOT BY A SINGLE WORD HAD NICHOLAS ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT
ROSY, WAS SITTING IN AN EASY CHAIR WITH HER WORK IN HER HANDS, TALKING

SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND BUT TO WHICH SHE ATTRIBUTED GREAT
SHE DID NOT KNOW AND WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT, BUT BENEATH THE LAYER
SHE DID NOT LET GO OF HER MOTHER BUT STRUGGLED TENDERLY WITH HER,
SHE DID NOT REMEMBER WHAT SHE HAD SAID, AND THAT SHE HAD NO TROUBLE
SHE DID NOT TALK ABOUT HER BROTHER, DIVERTING THE CONVERSATION AS SOON
SHE DID THE RIGHT THING WITH SUCH PRECISION, SUCH COMPLETE PRECISION,
SHE DOUBTS THE MEANS WE HAVE OF GAINING THEM. THAT IS THE ACTUAL PHRASE
SHE DREW NEAR TO HIM AND STOPPED. HE TOOK HER HAND AND KISSED IT.
SHE EXHALED HAPPINESS AND LOVE FROM THE TIME NICHOLAS RETURNED, AND THE
SHE FEEL ABLE TO THINK CLEARLY AND CALMLY OF PRINCE ANDREW AND ANATOLE,
SHE FELT AGITATED AND TORMENTED, AND THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS KURAGIN WHOM
SHE FELT ALL THE TIME AS IF SHE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT PENETRATE THAT
SHE FELT GUILTY.
SHE FELT HERSELF SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY THE ACRID SCENT OF OLD AGE
SHE FELT THAT FROM HER SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND LEARN
SHE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASK, OR TO ANSWER, IN WORDS.
SHE FINISHED HER GAME OF PATIENCE AND ONLY THEN EXAMINED THE PRESENTS.
SHE FORESAW. SHE DREW HER WOOL DOWN THROUGH THE CANVAS AND, SCARCELY
SHE FORGOT ALL FEAR OF HER FATHER, WENT UP TO HIM, TOOK HIS HAND, AND
SHE FOUND THEM ON MY TABLE AND SAID SHE'D SHOW THEM TO MAMMA, AND THAT
SHE GAVE HER COMPANION AN ANGRY GLANCE.
SHE GLANCED INTO IT. "THERE, THAT'S ME!" THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE
SHE GOT UP QUICKLY JUST AS NICHOLAS ENTERED, ALMOST RAN TO THE DOOR
SHE GREW CONFUSED, GLANCED ROUND, AND, SEEING THE DOLL SHE HAD THROWN
SHE HAD A FAN IN HER HAND THAT ONE OF THE LADIES HAD GIVEN HER TO HOLD.
SHE HAD ALREADY MARRIED OFF HER DAUGHTER, AND HER SONS WERE ALL IN THE
SHE HAD BEEN A SICK CHILD. THE LAST WEEKS PASSED IN HER MOTHER'S BEDROOM
SHE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE; BUT THAT DAY AS HE LOOKED AT HER PIERRE
SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO CLOSE HER EYES ON ACCOUNT OF HIS MOANING, AND AT
SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SLEEP THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT, AND TOLD HER HOW HE
SHE HAD CORRESPONDED FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, WAS IN MOSCOW, BUT PROVED
SHE HAD DEMANDS ON HER TIME WHICH COULD BE SATISFIED ONLY BY RENOUNCING
SHE HAD DETERMINED NOT TO TELL HER AND PERSUADED HER FATHER TO HIDE THE
SHE HAD ENTERED. SHE KNEW IT TO BE NECESSARY, AND THOUGH IT WAS HARD FOR
SHE HAD FALLEN ILL UNEXPECTEDLY A FEW DAYS PREVIOUSLY, HAD MISSED
SHE HAD FEARED, ORDER HER TO BE CARRIED AWAY BY FORCE BUT ONLY TOLD HER
SHE HAD FIRST ENTERED THE ROOM--THE SMILE OF A PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL
SHE HAD IN FACT SEEN NOTHING THEN BUT HAD MENTIONED THE FIRST THING THAT
SHE HAD JUST VACATED. "YOU HAVE MADE THE PLACE WARM, I MUST SAY," HE
SHE HAD LEARNED IT) SHE TALKED WITH HER PARTNER, FANNING HERSELF AND
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO BE QUITE FRANK, HAD NOW BECOME UNPLEASANT TO
SHE HAD NOT YET GONE TO BED WHEN THE ROSTOVS ARRIVED AND THE PULLEY OF
SHE HAD NOTICED WITH WHAT DISSATISFACTION HE TURNED FROM THE LOOK SHE
SHE HAD SACRIFICED SO MUCH. SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM WEEPING AT THESE
SHE HAD SAID SHE DID NOT WANT TO SING, BUT IT WAS LONG SINCE SHE HAD
SHE HAD SEEN HER GUESTS OUT.
SHE HAD SEEN.
SHE HAD SEIZED HIM, ROLLED OVER LIKE A BALL. THE HARE ARCHED HIS
SHE HAD WANTED TO CONCEAL WHAT SHE WAS WRITING FROM HIM, BUT AT THE SAME
SHE HAD WORN AT HER FIRST PETERSBURG BALL.
SHE HARDLY HEARD HIS VOICE THROUGH THE CLOSED DOORS.
SHE HAS NO ONE, NO ONE. TO TELL THE TRUTH, I DON'T NEED HER, AND SHE'S
SHE HEARD HIS GROANS AND MUTTERING, THE CREAK OF HIS BED, AND THE STEPS
SHE HEARD HIS VOICE A VIVID GLOW KINDLED IN HER FACE, LIGHTING UP BOTH
SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF QUICK FOOTSTEPS IN THE QUIET STREET. SOMEONE
SHE HEARD, OR THOUGHT SHE HEARD, THE NAMES OF KURAGIN AND BOLKONSKI. BUT
SHE HELD HERSELF AS ERECT, TOLD EVERYONE HER OPINION AS CANDIDLY,
SHE HESITATED FOR AN INSTANT WHETHER TO SPEAK OR NOT.
SHE HUMMED A SCRAP FROM HER FAVORITE OPERA BY CHERUBINI, THREW HERSELF
SHE INVITED THEM TO TAKE THE WOUNDED MAN INTO THE HOUSE.
SHE IS SO AFFECTED. ASK HER IN," SHE SAID TO THE FOOTMAN IN A SAD VOICE,
SHE IS SO... YOU KNOW?... UNPLEASANT... BUT MY FIANCEE!... WELL, YOU
SHE KNEW HAD THE PECULIAR PROPERTY OF CONDUCING TO CHEERFULNESS IN THE
SHE KNEW LET HER HAVE THE KEYS OF THE CATACOMBS, AND HOW SHE, TAKING
SHE KNEW OF THE DUEL AND HAD COME TO SPEAK ABOUT IT. SHE WAITED TILL THE
SHE KNEW SO WELL), ON THE LOCK OF GRAY HAIR THAT ESCAPED FROM UNDER THE
SHE LAUGHED; AT THE OTHER COULD BE HEARD THE STORY OF THE MISFORTUNES OF
SHE LAY FOR A LONG TIME IN THAT POSITION.
SHE LED HIM INTO THE DARK DRAWING ROOM AND PIERRE WAS GLAD NO ONE COULD
SHE LISTENED TO WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND THE DOOR AND, HEARING HIM
SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN DISMAY TRYING TO GUESS WHAT HE WANTED OF HER. WHEN
SHE LOOKED AT HIM INQUIRINGLY AND WITH CHILDLIKE REPROACH.
SHE LOOKED ROUND AND SEEING THAT HER FRIEND WAS NOT IN THE ROOM RAN TO
SHE LOOKED TIMIDLY AT HER BROTHER.
SHE LOVED HIM SHE NEED ONLY SAY THE WORD YES, AND NO HUMAN POWER COULD
SHE LOVED PRINCE ANDREW--SHE REMEMBERED DISTINCTLY HOW DEEPLY SHE LOVED
SHE LOVES HIM! SHE PROBABLY OPENED THE LETTER WITHOUT KNOWING WHO IT WAS
SHE MENTIONED NAPOLEON AND SOME OTHER EXALTED PERSONAGES), THAT SHE HAD
SHE MIGHT TO HIDE IT, AND PERTURBED AS SHE EVIDENTLY WAS EACH TIME HER
SHE MOVED TOWARD ANNA PAVLOVNA. HELENE WAS SO LOVELY THAT NOT ONLY
SHE MUST NOT SAY THIS AND THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DO SO. SHE ONLY
SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN. BUT IN YOUR CLUB THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING HIM
SHE NEVER WAS ABASHED AND IS NOT ABASHED NOW, SO SHE CANNOT BE A BAD
SHE NODDED TO THE DRESSMAKER, WHOM SHE KNEW AND WHO HAD CURTSIED
SHE NOT ONLY LEFT HER HAIR AS IT WAS, BUT DID NOT EVEN LOOK IN HER
SHE NOW SAW HIM FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THAT SCENE AND RELIVED WHAT SHE
SHE ONLY REALLY TOOK PART WHEN THEY RECALLED SONYA'S FIRST ARRIVAL. SHE
SHE ONLY REPEATED THAT SHE BEGGED HIM TO FORGET WHAT SHE HAD SAID, THAT
SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND STEPPED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD AND ONTO THE COLD,
SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND THE BRIGHT DAYLIGHT IN THAT PREVIOUSLY DARKENED
SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ASKED IT. HE SMILED, LOOKING AT HER, AND SAID HE
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID TO NATASHA, BUT SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SAY IT
SHE PASSED INTO THE SITTING ROOM, STOOD THERE THINKING AWHILE, AND THEN
SHE PASSED THE VALET, THE SNUFF FELL FROM THE CANDLE WICK, AND SHE SAW
SHE PAUSED, AS WOMEN ALWAYS DO, EXPECTING SOMETHING AFTER THEY HAVE
SHE PAUSED, FEELING THAT SHE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. NATASHA NOTICED
SHE PAUSED. SHE SO WANTED A WORD FROM HIM THAT WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER WHAT
SHE POINTED TO A LADY WHO WAS CROSSING THE ROOM FOLLOWED BY A VERY PLAIN
SHE PRAISED THE ROSTOVS' TOILETS. THEY PRAISED HER TASTE AND TOILET, AND
SHE PRAYED FOR THE MEMBERS OF HER OWN FAMILY, HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND
SHE PROVOKED THE JEALOUSY OF THE ELDERLY MAGNATE AND TOLD HIM WHAT SHE
SHE PULLED UP HER MUSLIN SLEEVE AND SHOWED HIM A RED SCAR ON HER LONG,
SHE PUSHED THE LITTLE DOG OFF HER LAP AND SMOOTHED HER DRESS.
SHE PUT HER LARGE HAND UNDER NATASHA'S FACE AND TURNED IT TOWARD HER.
SHE RAN ACROSS THE STREET, TURNED DOWN A SIDE STREET TO THE LEFT, AND,
SHE RAN TO HER FATHER, BUT HE FEEBLY WAVED HIS ARM, POINTING TO HER
SHE RAN TO MEET HER, EMBRACED HER, AND BEGAN TO CRY ON HER SHOULDER.
SHE RANG FOR HER MAID AND ASKED HER TO SLEEP IN HER ROOM.
SHE READ THIS IN TIKHON'S FACE AND IN THAT OF PRINCE VASILI'S VALET, WHO
SHE RECEIVED ON SUNDAYS.
SHE REMAINED ALONE WITH HIM FOR A MOMENT. PRINCE ANDREW SURPRISED HER BY
SHE RETURNED TO THE GARDEN AND SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS AT THE FOOT OF THE
SHE ROSE AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR, WHICH WAS AS USUAL SO EXTREMELY SMOOTH
SHE ROSE TO GO TO HER OWN ROOM.
SHE ROUSED HERSELF, AND FELT APPALLED AT WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THINKING, AND
SHE RUSHED TO SONYA, HUGGED HER, AND BEGAN TO CRY.
SHE SAID TIMIDLY AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE, "I HAVE A GREAT FAVOR TO ASK
SHE SAID TO PIERRE, "EVEN OUR DEAR COUSIN BORIS, WHO, BETWEEN OURSELVES,
SHE SAID WITH THE FACILITY IN LYING NATURAL TO A SOCIETY WOMAN. "WE WERE
SHE SAID, CONVULSIVELY PRESSING HER HANDS AND SETTING HER TEETH WITH A
SHE SAID, TURNING TO HER BROTHER, AS IF ASKING HIM: "WHAT IS IT MOVES ME
SHE SAID. "AND I WILL GO AND TELL HER IT IS NO USE EXPECTING HIM! AND
SHE SANG HER PRAISES, INSISTED THAT HER SON MUST CALL ON HER, EXPRESSED
SHE SANG.
SHE SAT AWHILE, WONDERING WHAT THE MEANING OF IT ALL HAVING HAPPENED
SHE SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE
SHE SAW BEFORE HER HIS SMOOTH HANDSOME FOREHEAD, HIS MUSTACHE, AND HIS
SHE SAW HIS FACE, HEARD HIS VOICE, REPEATED HIS WORDS AND HER OWN, AND
SHE SAYS IT'S VERY FINE."
SHE SEEMED HARDLY ABLE TO BEAR. THOUGH THE DIPLOMATISTS STILL FIRMLY
SHE SEEMED THAT DAY TO BE MORE THAN EVER KIND AND AFFECTIONATE TO
SHE SEEMED TO BE FOND NOT SO MUCH OF INDIVIDUALS AS OF THE FAMILY AS A
SHE SENT FOR HER HUSBAND AND, WHEN HE CAME, TRIED BRIEFLY AND COLDLY TO
SHE SHOULD BE IN THE WAY AND TRIED TO FIND EXCUSES FOR LEAVING THEM
SHE SHOULD NOT SPEAK FRENCH SO MUCH. IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR IT NOW."
SHE SHOULD ROUSE THE DOZING BABY.
SHE SMILED AS SHE UTTERED HIS PET NAME, "ANDRUSHA." IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
SHE SPENT THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTEENTH AS USUAL, WITHOUT UNDRESSING, IN
SHE SPOKE RAPIDLY AND DID NOT NOTICE HOW PIERRE FLUSHED AT HER WORDS. "I
SHE SPOKE SHE NOTICED WITH FEAR AND JOY THAT HE GAZED ATTENTIVELY AND
SHE SPOKE SHE RAISED HER EYES WITH A SIGH, AND HER GESTURE CONVEYED A
SHE SPOKE, MINGLING MOST TRIFLING DETAILS WITH THE INTIMATE SECRETS OF
SHE STARTED, FLUSHED, AND SIGHED DEEPLY.
SHE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND SANG A MUSICAL PHRASE THAT
SHE STOOD WITH HER SLENDER ARMS HANGING DOWN, HER SCARCELY DEFINED BOSOM
SHE STOPPED, SEEING IN THE FORWARD THRUST OF HER HUSBAND'S HEAD, IN HIS
SHE SUDDENLY CAME INTO HIS MIND AS SHE WAS AT THE MOMENTS WHEN HE HAD
SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED, SMILING AT HER OWN IMPETUOSITY.
SHE TERMED BENNIGSEN. SHE SAW THAT THEY GREW SPITEFUL WHEN THEY SPOKE TO
SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT HER ROMANCE WITH PRINCE ANDREW AND OF HIS VISIT TO
SHE TOOK A PAIR OF PEAR-SHAPED RUBY EARRINGS FROM HER HUGE RETICULE AND,
SHE TOOK HIS ARM AND WITH A HAPPY FACE WENT WITH HIM INTO THE ADJOINING
SHE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF INQUIRING WHETHER IT WAS LONG SINCE ANATOLE
SHE TOOK THE MONEY FROM UNDER THE HANDKERCHIEF.
SHE TREMBLED ALL OVER AND SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR.
SHE TRIED TO FOLLOW WITH UNDERSTANDING. WHEN SHE UNDERSTOOD THEM HER
SHE TRIED TO PASS ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA, BUT THE LATTER SPRANG SO AS TO BAR
SHE TURNED AWAY AND GAVE HER HAND TO THE COUNT, WHO COULD HARDLY KEEP
SHE TURNED ROUND. FOR A FEW SECONDS THEY GAZED SILENTLY INTO ONE
SHE TURNED TO GO, BUT HE STOPPED HER WITH A GESTURE AND TOOK AN UNCUT
SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE MEANT WHAT WERE THEIR PARENTS QUARRELING ABOUT.
SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN SPEAKING OF "TRASH" HE REFERRED NOT ONLY TO
SHE USED TO HAVE QUARRELS WITH THE TOO INDULGENT COUNT, THAT SON WHO HAD
SHE USED TO RUN WHEN PLAYING AT TAG, RAN THROUGH THE BALLROOM TO THE
SHE USED TO SAY. OFTEN SEEING THE SUCCESS SHE HAD WITH YOUNG AND OLD MEN
SHE VIVIDLY RECALLED THE MOMENT WHEN HE HAD HIS FIRST STROKE AND WAS
SHE WAS ALWAYS IMAGINING THAT. IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HER THAT EVERYONE
SHE WAS AS HE HAD KNOWN HER ALMOST AS A CHILD AND LATER ON AS PRINCE
SHE WAS DANCING WITH A GROWN-UP MAN, WHO HAD BEEN ABROAD. SHE WAS
SHE WAS EVIDENTLY UNABLE TO SPEAK AND MADE A SIGN WITH HER HANDS THAT
SHE WAS EXPECTING PRINCE ANDREW ANY MOMENT AND TWICE THAT DAY SENT A
SHE WAS GAZING IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE HAD GONE--TO THE OTHER SIDE
SHE WAS GAZING WHERE SHE KNEW HIM TO BE; BUT SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE HIM
SHE WAS HERSELF IN SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AT THAT MOMENT, SO FAR FROM SORROW,
SHE WAS HOLDING IN HER RETICULE.) "SO YOU PROMISE?"
SHE WAS MUCH ALTERED. SHE WAS NOW PLAIN RATHER THAN PRETTY. HER CHEEKS
SHE WAS NO LONGER IN THE LOOSE GOWN SHE GENERALLY WORE IN THE MORNING,
SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM AND NO ONE ELSE OUGHT TO BE. AFTER A FEW
SHE WAS NOT EVEN GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR IT; NOTHING GOOD ON PIERRE'S PART
SHE WAS NURSING HER BOY WHEN THE SOUND OF PIERRE'S SLEIGH WAS HEARD
SHE WAS OVERCOME BY SWEET SORROW AND TEARS WERE ALREADY RISING IN HER
SHE WAS RIGHT," HE THOUGHT, REMEMBERING WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE HAD
SHE WAS SO TIRED OF TALKING OF WHAT DID NOT INTEREST HER, AND HER
SHE WAS THE COUNTESS BEZUKHOVA, PIERRE'S WIFE, AND THE COUNT, WHO KNEW
SHE WAS TO DO WITH THESE PEOPLE. ON LEAVING THEM, ANNA PAVLOVNA AGAIN
SHE WAS TWENTY-SEVEN. AFTER THE DEATH OF HER BROTHERS SHE HAD BECOME
SHE WAS VERY STUPID, SOMETIMES ATTENDED, WITH A STRANGE FEELING OF
SHE WAS WITH SONYA. SONYA HAD CRIED AND BEGGED TO BE FORGIVEN AND NOW,
SHE WAS WITH THEM. NATASHA GREW PALE, IN A PANIC OF EXPECTATION, WHEN
SHE WAS, NATASHA, WHO KNEW HOW SENSITIVE HER MOTHER WAS TO ANYTHING
SHE WASHED, DRESSED, SAID HER PRAYERS, AND WENT OUT TO THE PORCH. IN
SHE WELL? MY QUARTERS ARE AT YOUR SERVICE."
SHE WENT IN AND SAT DOWN BY HER HUSBAND.
SHE WENT ON, WITH A HORROR AND DISGUST SHE COULD HARDLY CONCEAL.
SHE WENT ON: "NOWADAYS EVERYONE FINDS FAULT. A GOSPEL SOCIETY! WELL, AND
SHE WENT UP TO HER HUSBAND AND KISSED HIM ON THE FOREHEAD.
SHE WERE BLOSSOMING UNDER THE PRAISE OF THIS DEAR COUNTESS BEZUKHOVA WHO
SHE WISHED TO HELP HIM, TO BESTOW ON HIM THE SUPERABUNDANCE OF HER OWN
SHE WOKE LATE. THAT SINCERITY WHICH OFTEN COMES WITH WAKING SHOWED HER
SHE WOULD BE PLEASED TO GIVE--WITH HER CHARACTERISTIC RUSSIAN PATRIOTISM
SHE WOULD BEGIN TO SAY SOMETHING TO HER IN A LOW TONE FROM THE OTHER END
SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING AND WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING, BUT GAVE NO ACTUAL
SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE MARRIED TO ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME," THOUGHT HE.
SHE WOULD SAY. SHE SAID: "THIS CAN'T GO ON--IT WON'T. YOU WILL GET

STRANGE TO HIM THAT HIS LONG-FELT WISH, WHICH HAD SEEMED UNATTAINABLE,
STRANGE TO THEM BUT ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THE ONLY THING THAT COULD
STRANGE, NOT IN RUSSIAN. IN AMONG THE HINDMOST OF THESE MEN WEARING

STRENGTH AND CHARM OF HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH PRINCE ANDREW. THAT CHARM WAS
STRENGTH AND HEALTH, OF WHICH HE HAD TILL THEN BEEN UNCONSCIOUS, AND
STRENGTH AS THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS POSITION INCREASED.
STRENGTH IN LIFE SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN. AND THIS NOT ONLY
STRENGTH OF AN ARMY DEPENDS ON ITS SPIRIT. TO LEAD MEN FORWARD UNDER

TAKING HER ARM LED HER OUT TO THE VERANDA, SOOTHING HER AND TRYING TO

TALK ABOUT RURAL ECONOMY WITH THE COUNT, FASHIONS WITH THE COUNTESS
TALK ABOUT THAT THEY COULD NOT DISCUSS BEFORE THE OLD COUNTESS--NOT
TALK ABOUT THE RECEPTION OF A NEW BROTHER. THEY LAID ON ME THE DUTY OF
TALK AND TO HEAR A HUMAN VOICE. THE SATISFACTION OF ONE'S NEEDS--GOOD
TALK BUSINESS. HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE HORSE GUARDS?"
TALK IN GENERAL CENTERED ROUND THREE MELANCHOLY FACTS: THE EMPEROR'S
TALK OF ALL THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES HAVING BEEN ALREADY REMOVED FROM
TALK TO HIS DRIVER.
TALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT HIM. THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD NOT EXPRESS IN
TALK WITH BORIS. HE NEED NOT COME SO OFTEN...."
TALK WITH YOU, COUNTESS," HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE.
TALK, AND ESPECIALLY A QUICK GLANCE SONYA GAVE HER.
TALK, TEA, AND LIGHTED CANDLES.
TALK.
TALKED ABOUT HER HEALTH, AND THIS PLEASED HER. BUT SOMETIMES SHE WAS
TALKED SOME NONSENSE. DESSALLES, THAT FOOL, SAID SOMETHING. SOMETHING IN
TALKED TO HER. "PERHAPS I IMAGINED IT; PERHAPS I SHALL GO IN AND FIND
TALKED WITH NAPOLEON.
TALKING ABOUT HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT FRENCHWOMAN," THOUGHT NATASHA.
TALKING ABOUT.
TALKING AND LISTENING TOO EAGERLY AND TOO NATURALLY, WHICH WAS WHY ANNA
TALKING AS NOW, NICHOLAS DID NOT LEAVE SONYA'S SIDE, AND GAZED AT HER
TALKING AT ONCE, AND IT WAS SO STRANGE THAT SHE MUST HERSELF HAVE BEEN
TALKING BROKEN RUSSIAN TO THE SERVANTS, BUT WAS STILL THE SAME NARROWLY
TALKING CAME UP TO LISTEN. BERG, OBLIVIOUS OF IRONY OR INDIFFERENCE,
TALKING HIMSELF, AND CONTINUED TO TALK WITH THE SORT OF ELOQUENCE AND
TALKING IN LOW VOICES AND KUTUZOV SMILED SLIGHTLY AS TREADING HEAVILY
TALKING OF A LEVY OF TEN MEN PER THOUSAND. OH YES, LET ME CONGRATULATE
TALKING OF THE SCHON GRABERN AFFAIR? WERE YOU THERE?"

TALKING TO MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE. THE COUNTESS CARESSED THE BOY, AND
TALKING TO THE CORPORAL IMMEDIATELY ASKED WHAT THE FRENCHMAN HAD SAID.
TALKING TO THE EMPEROR HIMSELF, TO THAT VERY EMPEROR WHO HAD WRITTEN HIS
TALKING TO THEM ABOUT MATTERS UNCONNECTED WITH THE BATTLE.

TEARS OF JOY AND EXCITEMENT AND EMBRACING HER MOTHER.
TEARS OF JOY THAT FILLED HIS EYES, CONCENTRATED ALL HIS ENTHUSIASM
TEARS OF JOY, AND HE EMBRACED HIS WIFE WHO WAS GLAD TO HIDE HER LOOK OF
TEARS OF SADNESS AND RAPTURE. SO THE BOY ALSO WAS HAPPY THAT PIERRE HAD
TEARS OF TENDERNESS AND JOY THAT CHOKED HIM, AND WITHOUT FINDING THE
TEARS OF VEXATION SHOWED THEMSELVES IN PRINCESS MARY'S EYES. SHE TURNED

TELL A LONG STORY.

TELL ANYONE, BUT, OH GOD! WHAT AM I TO DO IF I LOVE NOTHING BUT FAME
TELL HER EVERYTHING!" SAID SHE TO PIERRE. "ONE HASN'T THE HEART TO SCOLD

TELL YOU, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN TREATING HER BADLY. WHAT A HEART SHE HAS,

THAT IS THE CHIEF THING," THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY; AND FEAR, WHICH SHE HAD
THAT IS THE POOR PEOPLE, AND THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES. AN ENORMOUS CROWD

THAT IT MUST ALL BE KEPT FROM HER FATHER AND ASSURING HER THAT NOBODY
THAT IT MUST LIVE IN WATER, SO GOD HAD MADE HIM SUCH THAT HE MUST SPEND
THAT IT PLAINLY AND INDUBITABLY PROVED THE FALLACY OF ALL THE PLANS FOR

THAT IT WAS ALL NONSENSE AND RUBBISH, AND HE DID NOT IN THE LEAST FEAR
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND MOSCOW AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

THAT IT WOULD SOON PASS IF ONLY THE COACHMAN WENT TO THE CHEMIST'S IN

THAT KIND OF THING. BUT WHEN HIS SERENITY TOOK COMMAND EVERYTHING BECAME
THAT KNOLL PIERRE HAD NO NOTION THAT THIS SPOT, ON WHICH SMALL TRENCHES

THAT MOMENT THIS CONVERSATION BEGAN, CONTRARY TO ALL THE LAWS OF LOGIC

THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING, AND AGAIN SETTLED DOWN IN HER FORMER
THAT SHE COULD NOT SHARE IT; BUT SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE JOYS AND
THAT SHE DID NOT TRY TO HIDE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER SAD, BUT
THAT SHE DID NOT--BUT WITH HER PREGNANCIES, HER CONFINEMENTS, THE
THAT SHE HAD BECOME FOND OF HIM. PIERRE DID NOT IN ANY WAY SEEK HER
THAT SHE HAD TO EMPLOY HER DIPLOMATIC TACT.
THAT SHE MADE A SIGN TO AN OFFICER WHO DROVE PAST, WHOM SONYA TOOK TO BE

THAT SOMEBODY ACTUALLY SUBMITTED SUCH A PROPOSAL TO HIM. BUT A COMMANDER
THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG DURING HIS ABSENCE, BUT IT WAS SO TERRIBLE
THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG. HE EXPECTED THE WOLF TO COME HIS WAY ANY
THAT SONG.
THAT SONYA HAD TOLD HER SOMETHING ABOUT PRINCE ANDREW WHOM SHE HAD SEEN
THAT STOOD IN HIS WAY, THREW HIMSELF ON THE SOFA.
THAT STRENGTH OF MIND WHICH HE THOUGHT CONSTITUTED HIS MERIT AND HIS
THAT STUPID PEOPLE MIGHT MEANLY DESPISE HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HUMBLE
THAT STUPID, MEANINGLESS, CONSTANTLY REPEATED FRAUD? ALWAYS THE SAME AND
THAT SUNDAY, THE ROSTOVS WENT TO MASS AT THE RAZUMOVSKIS' PRIVATE CHAPEL
THAT SURROUNDED THE EMPERORS.
THAT THAT MAN SUFFERS, AND THIS DON JUAN, WICKED FELLOW, IS TAKING
THAT THAT WAS NOT HE, BUT SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND HORRIBLE, SEIZED HER
THAT THE ADVANTAGE WAS NOW ON OUR SIDE. THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE
THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION
THAT THE BEE FLYING WITH THE POLLEN OF A MALE FLOWER TO A PISTIL
THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN AND INDEFINITE, AND THAT THE APPEARANCE
THAT THE CONVOY HAD FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN. DENISOV HAD TWO HUNDRED, AND
THAT THE CORSICAN MONSTER WHO IS DESTROYING THE PEACE OF EUROPE MAY
THAT THE ELDER HUSSAR'S LUCKLESS LOVE FOR NATASHA PLAYED A PART IN
THAT THE EMPEROR TALKED A LONG TIME WITH THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR, AND HOW
THAT THE ENEMY HAD BEEN IN A CERTAIN POSITION THE DAY BEFORE, BY THE
THAT THE EVENTS DEPENDED ON THOSE COMMANDS. BUT EXAMINING THE EVENTS
THAT THE FRENCH NO LONGER VENTURED TO ATTACK.
THAT THE FRENCH OFFICER'S HEAD HAD BEEN TORN OFF, SO SWIFTLY HAD HE
THAT THE FRENCH RETREAT FROM MOSCOW WAS A SERIES OF VICTORIES FOR
THAT THE FRENCH WERE NOT ALL CAPTURED OR DESTROYED WHEN OUR THREE ARMIES
THAT THE FRENCH WERE ONLY SOME TWENTY-FIVE MILES AWAY, THAT FRENCH
THAT THE GATES OF THE CITADEL HAD BEEN BARRICADED AND THAT THERE WAS
THAT THE GENERAL COULD NOT REFUSE. BUT WHEN DISPATCHING HIM HE RECALLED
THAT THE INCORRECT AND EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT WAS INVENTED (PROBABLY TO
THAT THE LATTER KNEW HIS FACE, AND ALL THOSE AT COURT, FAR FROM
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL VOTED FOR SUCH A RETREAT, AND ABOVE
THAT THE MAN WAS TAKING OFF HIS LEG BANDS, AND THE WAY HE DID IT AROUSED
THAT THE MAN WHO ADVOCATES THE CONCLUSION OF A PEACE, AND THAT THE
THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME SHE WAS FILLED WITH DREAD OF WHAT SHE MIGHT
THAT THE MOMENTOUS EVENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED THAT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THE
THAT THE MORE HE VALUED HER THE LESS HE LOVED HER. HE HAD TAKEN HER AT
THAT THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE DIRECTORY, AND BONAPARTE WERE MERE
THAT THE NEW FORCE THEY HAVE DEVISED DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENS
THAT THE NURSE HAD BEEN HIDING THE DEAD BABY. HE DREW THE CURTAIN ASIDE
THAT THE OLD MAN WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM. HE DREW NEARER AND SAW THAT THE
THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THEM WAS ONE OF GOOD HUMORED
THAT THE PRINCE WAS IN A BAD HUMOR, STOOD AWAITING HIM; MADEMOISELLE
THAT THE PRINCESS' OFFER OF CORN TO THE PEASANTS THE PREVIOUS DAY, AND
THAT THE PUPILS' PARENTS WEPT AT HAVING TO LET HIM TAKE THEIR CHILDREN
THAT THE QUESTION OF HIS WIFE'S GUILT WHICH HAD BEEN TORMENTING HIM THE
THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HIM AND HERSELF COULD LEAD TO LOVE ON HER
THAT THE ROSTOVS INVOLUNTARILY CAME TO THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING,
THAT THE SIZE OF ANY ARMY DOES NOT COINCIDE WITH ITS STRENGTH AND THAT
THAT THE SOLE WEAPON AGAINST HIM WAS PRAYER, AND SHE TRIED TO PRAY. SHE
THAT THE SOVEREIGN HIMSELF SHOULD NOT BE WITH THE ARMY."
THAT THE STRANGE LADY, THE AIDE-DE-CAMP, AND SOME OF THE SERVANTS, ALL
THAT THE SUN OR THE EARTH HAD A PROPERTY OF ATTRACTION; HE SAID THAT ALL
THAT THE VARIOUS OPERATIONS NECESSARY TO FREE HER FROM HER HUSBAND
THAT THE WAR HAS RUINED YOU. THAT IS OUR COMMON MISFORTUNE, AND I
THAT THE WHISTLING AND THE TURNING OF WHEELS ARE THE CAUSE OF THE
THAT THE WOLF SHOULD COME HIS WAY. HE PRAYED WITH THAT PASSIONATE AND
THAT THEIR FOREMOST RANKS WERE MIXED UP WITH SOME FOREIGN CAVALRY
THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY WIVES WITH HUSBANDS SUCH AS YOU WHO WOULD NOT
THAT THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND THE
THAT THERE WERE PRECEDENTS (THERE WERE UP TO THAT TIME VERY FEW, BUT
THAT THEREFORE EVERY EMERGENCE OF A NEW POWER, EVERY STRUGGLE
THAT THESE THOUGHTS HAD BEEN SUGGESTED TO PRINCE ANDREW BY HIS FATHER'S
THAT THESE WILL BE SAFEGUARDED, SINCE SUCH IS THE WILL OF THE GREATEST
THAT THEY CAN POSSIBLY DISOBEY. HAVING WRUNG A SUBMISSIVE "I UNDERSTAND"
THAT THEY DESPAIRED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF CHECKING THIS DISORDER.
THAT THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND DID IT OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL,
THAT THEY LOOKED HEAVIER BELOW, WERE TWITCHING VIOLENTLY; BUT HE WORE
THAT THEY MAY RUN SMOOTHLY.
THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE WITH THEM. THE COUNTESS SENT FOR HER HUSBAND.
THAT THEY WANTED TO REUNITE HIM WITH HIS WIFE, AND IN THE MOOD HE THEN
THAT THEY WERE ALL HURRYING--NOT AS MEN HURRY TO DO SOMETHING THEY
THAT THEY WERE NOT ATTENDING ON HIM (HE WAS NO LONGER THERE, HE HAD LEFT
THAT THEY WOULD SPEAK NOTHING BUT RUSSIAN AND THAT THOSE WHO MADE A

THAT THIS IS ADMIRABLE, THIS IS GLORY--IT RESEMBLES CAESAR AND ALEXANDER
THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING!" HE SIGHED DEEPLY AND RODE BACK TO GORKI.
THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS FORCE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED THESE MEN AND THAT IT
THAT THIS TALE REDOUNDED TO THE GLORY OF OUR ARMS AND SO ONE HAD TO
THAT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD DESIRED AND EXPECTED. TURNING TO HIS
THAT THIS WAS UNNECESSARY AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD TEACH
THAT THIS WAS UNNECESSARY.
THAT THOSE IN THE DRAWING ROOM HEARD HER AND WERE STARTLED. "WHY DO YOU
THAT THOSE LIVING IN IT AIMED AT KEEPING IT SPOTLESS--BUT NEITHER WAS
THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY
THAT THOUGH ALL THIS WAS TRUE, AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED, YET THE
THAT TIME AND NOW THE WHOLE FRENCH ARMY WAS THERE. ERMOLOV WISHED TO ACT
THAT TIME AND OF HIS LOVE FOR NATASHA, AND PASSED AT ONCE TO WHAT NOW
THAT TIME PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF EVENTS BUT WERE
THAT TIME THAT IT ALL RESULTED FROM THE FACT THAT THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN
THAT TIME:
THAT TONIGHT HE WAS A PERSON OBLIGED TO PERFORM SOME SORT OF AWFUL
THAT UNKNOWN QUANTITY IS THE SPIRIT OF THE ARMY, THAT IS TO SAY, THE
THAT VERY BOLKONSKI WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO HIS SISTER.
THAT VERY NIGHT IF POSSIBLE. WITH A WOMAN'S INVOLUNTARY LOVING CUNNING
THAT VERY OFTEN IN SPITE OF THE PLAINNESS OF HER FACE THEY GAVE HER AN
THAT VILLAGE, AMID THE SMOKE, WAS SOMETHING RESEMBLING A BATTERY, BUT IT
THAT WAS ALL DONE BY THE SOLDIERS. THEREFORE IT WAS NOT HE WHO KILLED
THAT WAS AS YET BURNING ONLY AT ONE END, JUST BELOW THE ROOF, AND AROUND
THAT WAS GOOD IN IT--EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND
THAT WAS GOOD.
THAT WAS HIS QUICK TEMPER TOGETHER WITH HIS OLD HUSSAR HABIT OF MAKING
THAT WAS IT WAS NOT THAT WHICH TORMENTED PIERRE AT THE MOMENT. HE WAS
THAT WAS NEAR TO THE MAN SHE LOVED; AND OF PITY, SUFFERING FOR OTHERS,
THAT WAS NECESSARY SO AS TO GET FROM UNDER THAT CEILING, OUT INTO THE
THAT WAS NOT PRETTY, BUT NEITHER MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE NOR THE LITTLE
THAT WAS NOT WHAT MADE HER UNRECOGNIZABLE; SHE WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE AT THE
THAT WAS NOW DEEP AND NOW SHRILL:
THAT WAS SMOLDERING IN THE MORNING LIGHT, STOPPED SUDDENLY, AND PETYA
THAT WAS STRANGE.
THAT WAS SWAYING FROM ITS WEIGHT IN PRINCE ANDREW'S HANDS, BUT HE
THAT WAS THE ONLY DOUBT OFTEN TROUBLING PIERRE. HE DID NOT NOW MAKE ANY
THAT WAS UNANSWERABLE. IT WAS MORE THAN TRUE.
THAT WAS WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM TWO DAYS BEFORE PRINCESS MARY'S
THAT WAS WHAT THE OFFICERS DESIRED. BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE
THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM. THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IN
THAT WAY. HALFWAY LAY SOME SNOW-COVERED PILES OF FIREWOOD AND ACROSS AND
THAT WE ARE NOT IN OTRADNOE, BUT IN FAIRYLAND. AND THEN I THOUGHT... NO,
THAT WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE HER, AND THAT THEY WERE GLAD TO YIELD TO
THAT WEALLY STILL GOING ON?"
THAT WENT ON AROUND HIM AND TO NOTE IT DOWN. AT THE TIME OF THE MEETING
THAT WERE AFLOAT, AND SO KUTUZOV'S SUGGESTION OF AN AUSTRIAN VICTORY
THAT WERE BROUGHT HIM AND GAVE DIRECTIONS WHEN HIS SUBORDINATES DEMANDED
THAT WERE COVERED WITH SORES--HIS FOOTGEAR HAVING LONG SINCE FALLEN TO
THAT WERE RUNNING PAST, AND DEMANDED REINFORCEMENTS WHICH DID NOT
THAT WHEN HE WAS THERE COUNT NICHOLAS WOULD CEASE GOING EVERY DAY TO
THAT WHEN WE ARE THROWN OUT OF OUR USUAL RUTS ALL IS LOST, BUT IT IS
THAT WHICH CAUSED RUSSIANS TO GRIEVE, HE HAD SUCH A SAD FACE WHEN SHOWN
THAT WHILE NAPOLEON'S PROCLAMATION WAS BEING READ TO THE TROOPS THE
THAT WHOLE NATION TO SUBMIT. AN ARMY GAINS A VICTORY, AND AT ONCE THE
THAT WILL BY OTHERS.
THAT WINTER THE KARAGINS' HOUSE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE AND HOSPITABLE
THAT WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SHE HAD COME TO FEEL HERSELF TERRIBLY NEAR TO
THAT WORDS CAN BE THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF MILLIONS OF
THAT WORLD SOME STRUCTURE WAS STILL BEING ERECTED AND DID NOT FALL,
THAT WOULD ASTONISH PEOPLE, TO PERFORM SOME PATRIOTICALLY HEROIC
THAT YEAR TWO MARRIAGES HAD COME OF THESE BALLS. THE TWO PRETTY YOUNG
THAT YEAR, AS ALL HIS ESTATES HAD BEEN REMORTGAGED, AND SO NICHOLAS,
THAT YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO ON PRETENSE OF SAVING MANKIND WISH TO

THAT YOU WON'T MARRY HER."

THAT'S ALL THERE IS IN WHAT IS CALLED HEROISM! AND DID I DO IT FOR MY

THAT'S CERTAIN! THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY--GUEWILLA WARFARE!"
THAT'S ENOUGH, PLEASE LEAVE OFF!" PRINCE ANDREW PAINFULLY ENTREATED
THAT'S NOT IT." SOMETHING ELSE, RESEMBLING REMORSE, TORMENTED HIM. "YES,
THAT'S NOT WHAT IS NEEDED NOW.
THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS BROUGHT UP, AND EVERYBODY DOES IT. BUT WHAT A
THAT'S THE WAY THEY TREAT ME! NO CONFIDENCE IN ME! AH, ORDERED TO KEEP
THAT'S THE WAY."
THAT'S WHAT I'M UP TO."
THAT, AVAILING YOURSELF OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU MIGHT ADVANTAGEOUSLY
THAT, BELIEVE ME, IS WHY I AM SO FOND OF YOU. FEW PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND
THAT, EVEN IF ONLY ONE GUEST WAS PRESENT, THEIR EVENING HAD BEGUN VERY
THAT, EVEN MORE THAN IN MOSCOW, HE FELT A SENSE OF BEWILDERMENT, BUSTLE,
THAT, FOR CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS HE COULD NOT KNOW OF, THIS WAS
THAT, HE HAD EXPERIENCE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT NOTHING HAPPENS IN WAR AT
THAT, HEARING HE WAS IN A BAD HUMOR, SHE HAD DECIDED NOT TO APPEAR.
THAT, IT MEANS THAT I LOVED HIM FROM THE FIRST. IT MEANS THAT HE IS
THAT, NICHOLAS HAD TOLD HIS WIFE ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND
THAT, THE OFFICER, LIFTING HIS ELBOW WITH A SMART GESTURE, STROKED HIS

THE EXTINCTION OF LIFE THERE IS A SEVERANCE, A SPIRITUAL WOUND, WHICH
THE EYES OF THE GENERAL AND THE SOLDIER MET. THE GENERAL BECAME SILENT,
THE EYES OF THE GUARDSMAN'S HORSE. THE HEAVY BLACK HORSE, SIXTEEN HANDS

THE FACT THAT ONLY THOSE CAME WHO WISHED TO DANCE AND AMUSE THEMSELVES
THE FACT THAT PIERRE WAS VERY RICH, HAD TWO MANSIONS IN MOSCOW, AND THAT
THE FACT WAS ACCORDINGLY CONVEYED TO LAVRUSHKA.

THE FAMOUS FLANK MOVEMENT MERELY CONSISTED IN THIS: AFTER THE ADVANCE
THE FAR DISTANCE FINDS WHAT HE SOUGHT AT HIS VERY FEET. ALL HIS LIFE
THE FARTHER FORWARD AND NEARER THE ENEMY HE WENT, THE MORE ORDERLY AND

THE FAULTS HE HAD--IF HE HAD ANY--WERE NOT OF HIS MAKING. SO HE DID
THE FAVORS OF A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE AND BORIS HAD ONLY RECENTLY
THE FEAR OF HER FATHER, AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOVE AND OF FAMILY
THE FEELING HE HAD NOTICED BETWEEN HIS PROTEGEE NATASHA AND PRINCE
THE FEELING, "IT HAS BEGUN! HERE IT IS!" WAS SEEN EVEN ON PRINCE

THE FRENCH LINE ON THE HILL FIRES FLARED UP AND THE SHOUTING GREW LOUDER

THE FRENCH ONLOOKERS AND LISTENERS LAUGHED.
THE FRENCH PATROL WAS ONE OF THOSE SENT OUT THROUGH THE VARIOUS

THE FRENCH SENTENCES WHICH TO THEM WERE MEANINGLESS, WITH AN AIR OF
THE FRENCH SOLDIERS WENT TO KILL AND BE KILLED AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
THE FRENCH STATIONED AT TARUTINO; THE NEWS OF EASY SUCCESSES GAINED BY
THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY NEAR. PRINCE ANDREW, WALKING BESIDE BAGRATION,
THE FRENCH WERE FIRING, AND HE FELT HIS HEART PALPITATING AS HE RODE
THE FRENCH WERE FLEEING TOWARD SMOLENSK, THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF SUCH
THE FRENCH WERE IN MOSCOW, AND (ABOVE ALL) A DIM CONSCIOUSNESS IN EVERY

THE FRENCH WHO HAD BEEN PURSUING HIM STOPPED.
THE FRENCH WHO HAD OCCUPIED THE BATTERY FLED, AND OUR TROOPS SHOUTING
THE FRENCH WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE ROAD FOR THE FRENCH

THE FRONT OF HIS SQUADRON, AND BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO FINISH GIVING THE
THE FRONT, IN THE VERY CENTER, LEANING BACK AGAINST THE ORCHESTRA RAIL,
THE FROZEN WINDOW, SHE FELT STILL SADDER AND MORE IN LOVE, AND FORGOT
THE FRUIT. AN OLD PEASANT WHOM PRINCE ANDREW IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD OFTEN
THE FULL MOON FELL ON THE FLOOR. DIMMLER HAD FINISHED THE PIECE BUT

THE FUNDAMENTAL AND ESSENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EUROPEAN EVENTS OF THE

THE GAME CONTINUED; A WAITER KEPT HANDING ROUND CHAMPAGNE.
THE GAME. SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND, SCREWING UP HER EYES STERNLY, CONTINUED
THE GATE AND BY MOREL, WHO CAME TO SAY THAT SOME WURTTEMBERG HUSSARS HAD
THE GATES AND BEGAN PITCHING THEIR CAMP IN THE SENATE SQUARE. OUT OF THE
THE GATEWAY OF THE COURTYARD. IN THE DENSE WAVERING SMOKE SOME OF THE
THE GENERAL ASKED HIM TO RESTORE IT. ALL HIS ABSENT-MINDEDNESS AND
THE GENERAL BOWED HIS HEAD RESPECTFULLY, AND THE MONARCH MOUNTED AND
THE GENERAL CONFUSION. THE MEN OF THIS PARTY HAD BOTH THE QUALITY
THE GENERAL COURSE OF AFFAIRS AND AS TO THE MAN TO WHOM IT HAD BEEN
THE GENERAL FROWNED, TURNED AWAY, AND WENT ON.
THE GENERAL FROWNED. THOUGH THERE WAS NO DEFINITE NEWS OF AN AUSTRIAN
THE GENERAL HAD A FIT OF COUGHING AS A RESULT OF SHOUTING AND OF THE
THE GENERAL HAD BEGUN SUCH A DISCUSSION AND SO BERG DREW PIERRE TO IT.
THE GENERAL HAD SO WISHED TO DO THIS AND WAS SO SORRY HE HAD NOT MANAGED
THE GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THE STORES GALLOPED AFTER THE CARRIAGE WITH A
THE GENERAL MERRIMENT STOPPED AND THE GUESTS BEGAN TO CONVERSE SENSIBLY
THE GENERAL MOUNTED A HORSE A COSSACK HAD BROUGHT HIM. PIERRE WENT TO
THE GENERAL OPINION OF ALL WHO HAD KNOWN HIM PREVIOUSLY WAS THAT HE HAD
THE GENERAL STAFF!" HE SAID WITH A SMILE, KNOWING THAT THOSE WORDS WOULD
THE GENERAL STATE OF AFFAIRS, AND WHEN ROSTOV SPOKE OF THESE MATTERS DID
THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS RARELY SPOKEN OF, PARTLY BECAUSE
THE GENERAL'S FACE CLOUDED, HIS LIPS QUIVERED AND TREMBLED. HE TOOK OUT
THE GENERAL, WHO LOOKED THROUGH HIS FIELD GLASS.
THE GENERAL. "IN THE HEAT OF A BATTLE IT IS EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE. GO
THE GENERAL... THIRD COMPANY TO THE COMMANDER." THE WORDS PASSED ALONG
THE GENERALS ESPIED HIM AND, HEARING WHAT HE HAD COME ABOUT, INFORMED
THE GENERALS SEEMED TO LISTEN RELUCTANTLY TO THE DIFFICULT DISPOSITIONS.
THE GENERALS WERE PASSING BY, LOOKING AS IF THEY WISHED TO AVOID
THE GENIUS NAPOLEON AND, SUDDENLY RECOGNIZING HIM AS A BRIGAND, SENT HIM
THE GENTLEMEN AND MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE ROSE AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS,
THE GENTLEMEN AROUND.
THE GENTLEMEN ASSEMBLED AT BILIBIN'S WERE YOUNG, WEALTHY, GAY SOCIETY
THE GERMAN CLOSED HIS EYES, SIGNIFYING THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND.
THE GERMAN LAUGHED, CAME OUT OF THE COWSHED, PULLED OFF HIS CAP, AND
THE GERMAN VILLAGE OF SALZENECK. THE BEST QUARTERS IN THE VILLAGE WERE
THE GESTURE OF A MAN TOO BUSY TO LOSE A MOMENT, GLANCED AT KUTUZOV AND,
THE GIRL IN WHITE WENT UP TO THE PROMPTER'S BOX AND A MAN WITH TIGHT
THE GIRL SMILED AND TOOK IT. NESVITSKI LIKE THE REST OF THE MEN ON THE
THE GIRLS SPRANG ASIDE. DENISOV HID HIS HAIRY LEGS UNDER THE BLANKET,
THE GIRLS' EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE DOWAGER
THE GLEAMING ICONS STOOD A LONG INVALID CHAIR, AND IN THAT CHAIR
THE GLOW OF THE FIRST FIRE THAT BEGAN ON THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER WAS
THE GOAL IS REACHED. AFTER THE FINAL WAR OF 1815 ALEXANDER POSSESSES ALL
THE GOOD OF THAT? WAR IS MY PROFESSION, BUT HIS BUSINESS IS TO REIGN
THE GOOD-NATURED EXPRESSION STILL MORE APPARENT, AND GAZED AT HIS FRIEND
THE GORY TRACE OF THAT RECOLLECTION WOULD NOT PASS WITH TIME, BUT THAT
THE GOVERNMENT--AN ACTIVITY THAT IN THE OPINION OF THE HISTORIANS WAS
THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE LED HIM UP TO A TALL AND VERY STOUT OLD LADY WITH
THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE PRESSED HIS ELBOW GRATEFULLY.
THE GRAND CROSS OF MARIA THERESA, AND THE WHOLE ARMY RECEIVED REWARDS.
THE GRAND MASTER BEGAN READING THE STATUTES. THEY WERE VERY LONG, AND
THE GRAND MASTER PROPOSED THAT THE LAST DUTY SHOULD BE PERFORMED, AND
THE GRAND MASTER RAPPED WITH HIS MALLET. ALL THE MASONS SAT DOWN IN
THE GRANDEE'S WELL-KNOWN MANSION ON THE ENGLISH QUAY GLITTERED WITH
THE GRAY-HAIRED VALET WAS SITTING DROWSILY LISTENING TO THE SNORING OF
THE GREAT AND IS THEREFORE GOOD.
THE GREAT HALLS WERE FULL. IN THE FIRST WERE THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY IN
THE GREAT MAN'S MERCY; THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA CONSIDERS IT A FAVOR THAT
THE GREAT NATURAL FORCES LIE OUTSIDE US AND WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF
THE GREAT RECEPTION ROOM AND, BOWING POLITELY, ASKED BALASHEV TO FOLLOW
THE GREAT STANDING ARMIES SHOULD BE REDUCED HENCEFORTH TO MERE GUARDS
THE GREAT THING IS TO LIVE IN HARMONY...."
THE GREATER OR LESSER DESIRE TO FIGHT AND TO FACE DANGER. ONLY THEN,
THE GREATER PART OF THE MEN HAD TO HALT AND AN UNPLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS
THE GREATER THEIR ACHIEVEMENT. HOW DOES GOD ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR
THE GREATEST CRUSH DURING THE MOVEMENT OF THE TROOPS TOOK PLACE AT THE
THE GREATEST WAR THERE EVER WAS, AND I KNOW NOTHING AND AM FIT FOR
THE GREATNESS OF SOMETHING INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT ALL-IMPORTANT."
THE GRIEF FELT BY THE SUBJECTS HE WAS ABANDONING, LATTERLY, AFTER HE
THE GROOM, THE COACHMAN, AND THE INNKEEPER TOLD PIERRE THAT AN OFFICER
THE GROUND WITH HIS HAND. THE OTHER GENERALS FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE,
THE GROUND, THE OTHER BEING CAUGHT IN THE STIRRUP. HIS EYES, SCREWED
THE GROUP AND SHOUTED AT MISHKA.
THE GROUP OF PRISONERS HAD MELTED AWAY MOST OF ALL. OF THE THREE HUNDRED

THE GROWN-UP MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, NOT TO MENTION HIS WIFE, WERE

THE GUESTS GOT UP AND TOOK THEIR LEAVE, PROMISING TO RETURN TO DINNER.
THE GUESTS WELCOMED PIERRE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HELPED TO ENLIVEN AND UNITE
THE GUESTS. "THE VICOMTE IS A WONDERFUL RACONTEUR," SAID SHE TO ANOTHER.
THE GUITAR, AND WENT TO THE DRAWING ROOM.
THE GUN FROM WHICH THEY HAD REMOVED THE DEAD OFFICER. THE CLOAK THEY

THE HABIT OF RUNNING, TROTTED AWKWARDLY STUMBLING ON HIS TOES TOWARD THE
THE HAIR OF THE BARED HEADS AND WITH THE RIBBONS DECORATING THE ICON.
THE HAIR WAS WET, SO PROFUSELY HAD THE CHILD PERSPIRED. HE WAS NOT DEAD,
THE HALF-BURNED HOUSE AGAINST WHICH PIERRE WAS LEANING.
THE HALF-CLOSED EYES WAS THERE GREEDILY GNAWING A MUTTON BONE, AND THE
THE HALL AND ANTEROOM, AS IF SOMEONE HAD ARRIVED.
THE HALL DOOR SQUEAKED FROM THE COLD AS IT LET IN THE ROSTOVS AND THEIR

THE HANDSOME VERA SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY BUT DID NOT SEEM AT ALL HURT.
THE HANDSOME VERA, WHO PRODUCED SUCH AN IRRITATING AND UNPLEASANT EFFECT
THE HANDSOME YOUNG EMPEROR ALEXANDER, IN THE UNIFORM OF THE HORSE
THE HANDSOME YOUNG SOLDIER WHO HAD BROUGHT THE WOOD, SETTING HIS ARMS
THE HAPPIER FOR IT?" SO THOUGHT PRINCE BOLKONSKI WHILE DRESSING, AND
THE HATRED OF THE FRENCH THAT ALL SONS OF THE FATHERLAND SHOULD CHERISH.
THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN HAD ALREADY DESCENDED INTO THE HOLLOW. THE CLASH
THE HEAD THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING THIS INFORMATION.
THE HEADQUARTERS WERE SITUATED TWO MILES AWAY FROM SALZENECK, AND
THE HEAVINESS OF HIS HEAD AND CHEST REMINDED HIM OF THE POSSIBILITY
THE HIGH BEDSTEAD WITH ITS SILKEN HANGINGS. ON LEAVING THE BED BOTH
THE HIGH SPRINGS CREAKED, AND THE BODY OF THE COACH SWAYED. THE FOOTMAN
THE HIGH-SHOULDERED FIGURE OF ZHERKOV, FAMILIAR TO THE PAVLOGRADS AS HE
THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES AND THE POLICE ORGANIZED THE DISTRIBUTION OF
THE HIGHER LAWS.
THE HIGHEST LAW THOU SHALT REGAIN TRACES OF THE ANCIENT DIGNITY WHICH
THE HILL AT MOZHAYSK AND MOMENTARILY ON MANY AND MANY FACES HE HAD MET
THE HILL NOT TO GO BEYOND THE STREAM, BUT ROSTOV PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR
THE HILL ON FOOT.
THE HILL TO SUPPORT THE BATTERY. AS THEY TOOK THE PLACES VACATED BY THE
THE HILL TO THE RIGHT IN THE COURTYARD OF THE FARM, AS HE CALLED THE
THE HILL, THEY THREW UP THEIR CAPS AND SHOUTED: "VIVE L'EMPEREUR!" AND
THE HILL.
THE HISTORIAN WHO JUDGES ALEXANDER WILL ALSO AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOME
THE HISTORIANS CALL THIS ACTIVITY OF THE HISTORICAL FIGURES "THE
THE HISTORIANS CONSIDER THAT, NEXT TO THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THE

THE HOLY OF HOLIES OF THE ORDER. THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS

THE HONORS OF THE DISTRICT, BUT WAS IN REALITY A GOOD GENERAL, USEFUL
THE HOPE OF A LESS CRUEL FATE, SHOULD BE CERTAIN THAT INEVITABLE AND
THE HOPE OF AN ALLIANCE WITH HER.
THE HORSE GUARDS WERE GALLOPING, BUT STILL HOLDING IN THEIR HORSES.
THE HORSE GUARDS.
THE HORSES ALSO HAD BEEN FED FOR A FORTNIGHT ON STRAW FROM THE THATCHED
THE HORSES STEPPED OVER THE FIELD AS OVER A THICK CARPET, NOW AND THEN
THE HORSES THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN INVISIBLE COULD NOW BE SEEN TO THEIR
THE HORSES WERE BROUGHT.
THE HORSES WERE BROUGHT. DENISOV WAS ANGRY WITH THE COSSACK BECAUSE THE
THE HORSES' CROUPS BEGAN TO SWAY IN THE FRONT LINE. ROOK PULLED AT THE
THE HOSPITAL WAS IN A BRICK BUILDING WITH SOME OF THE WINDOW FRAMES AND
THE HOSPITAL WAS IN A SMALL PRUSSIAN TOWN THAT HAD BEEN TWICE DEVASTATED
THE HOST'S FATHER AND MOTHER, AND OF HIMSELF IN MILITARY UNIFORM. THE
THE HOUNDS WERE FIT (DANIEL HIMSELF WISHED TO GO HUNTING), NICHOLAS
THE HOUNDS WERE JOINED INTO ONE PACK, AND "UNCLE" AND NICHOLAS RODE ON
THE HOUNDS, AND THE HUNTSMAN THAT HE WAS BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THAT

THE HOUSE AND FELT AT EASE ONLY WITH HER BROTHER PETYA. SHE LIKED TO
THE HOUSE BUT REMAINED IN THE VILLAGE AWAITING HER DEPARTURE. WHEN HER
THE HOUSE HAD ESCAPED THE FIRE; IT SHOWED SIGNS OF DAMAGE BUT ITS

THE HUMAN RACE WHILE OURSELVES SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF BASENESS AND

THE HUNTSMAN STANDING IN THE HOLLOW MOVED AND LOOSED HIS BORZOIS, AND
THE HUNTSMAN STOOD HALFWAY UP THE KNOLL HOLDING UP HIS WHIP AND THE
THE HUNTSMEN GOT THE FOX, BUT STAYED THERE A LONG TIME WITHOUT STRAPPING
THE HUNTSMEN WERE ALREADY NEARING IT. ROSTOV, HAVING FINALLY SETTLED
THE HUSBAND CAME UP AND SULLENLY ASKED HIS WIFE WHAT SHE WAS TALKING
THE HUSBAND SMILED GLOOMILY, THE WIFE GAILY. THE GOVERNOR'S GOOD-NATURED
THE HUSSAR DID NOT REPLY.
THE HUSSAR OFFICERS.
THE HUSSAR ONLY SIGHED WITHOUT REPLYING AND COUGHED ANGRILY. THE SOUND
THE HUSSAR TOOK THE CUP.
THE HUSSAR. HE WAS SUCCUMBING TO IRRESISTIBLE, YOUTHFUL, CHILDISH
THE HUSSARS AND COSSACKS CROWDED ROUND THE PRISONERS; ONE OFFERED THEM
THE HUSSARS CROWDED ROUND AND RESPONDED HEARTILY WITH LOUD SHOUTS.
THE HUSSARS RAN BACK TO THE MEN WHO HELD THEIR HORSES; THEIR VOICES
THE HUSSARS REMAINED IN THE SAME PLACE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. A CANNONADE
THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS. WHEN HE

THE ICON STAND. TO HER SURPRISE AND DISTRESS SHE FOUND THAT HER PRAYERS
THE ICON WAS CARRIED FURTHER, ACCOMPANIED BY THE THRONG. PIERRE STOPPED
THE ICON. THEY, THOSE STRANGE MEN HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN, STOOD OUT
THE ICONS AND THERE WAS A PLEASANT SCENT OF FLOWERS AND BURNT PASTILLES.
THE ICONS, AS THOUGH DECLARING TO ALL THAT SHE COULD NOT ANSWER
THE IDEA OF BEING MADE A FOOL OF AND OF HAVING THROWN AWAY THAT WHOLE
THE IDEA OF DEFEAT AND FLIGHT COULD NOT ENTER ROSTOV'S HEAD. THOUGH HE

THE KNOLL.

THE LAST PART. IN PARTICULAR, THE WORDS "I WILL COME BACK TO DINNER,"

THE PREVIOUS EVENING AT BORIS'--RAN FORWARD AND, BOWING RESPECTFULLY
THE PRIEST WHOSE HOME IT WAS, AND THAT SHE INTENDED TO OFFER HIS SERENE
THE PRIEST'S WIFE, FLUSHING ROSY RED, CAUGHT UP THE DISH SHE HAD AFTER
THE PRIESTS AND DEACONS AND SOME SERVANTS ALSO WENT IN AT THE DOOR.
THE PRIESTS, ROSE AND OFFERED HIM HER SEAT; AN AIDE-DE-CAMP PICKED UP
THE PRINCE AGAIN LAUGHED HIS FRIGID LAUGH.
THE PRINCE AND SMILING AMIABLY AT HIM AS IF TO SHOW THAT POLITICAL
THE PRINCE ANSWERED NOTHING, BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY,
THE PRINCE BOWED HIS HEAD AND WENT UP TO THE PORCH. "GOD BE THANKED,"
THE PRINCE BOWED TO SIGNIFY HIS RESPECT AND GRATITUDE.
THE PRINCE HAD A LIST OF THINGS TO BE BOUGHT IN SMOLENSK AND, WALKING
THE PRINCE HAD AGED VERY MUCH THAT YEAR. HE SHOWED MARKED SIGNS OF
THE PRINCE HAD RECEIVED THE ROSTOVS, PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE HOW UPSET
THE PRINCE LOOKED AT HIS DAUGHTER'S FRIGHTENED FACE AND SNORTED.
THE PRINCE SHOOK HIS HEAD, AGAIN REPEATED THE SAME SOUNDS.
THE PRINCE STOPPED. HE SAW THE EFFECT THESE WORDS HAD PRODUCED ON HIS
THE PRINCE TRIED TO COMFORT HER, BUT HELENE, AS IF QUITE DISTRAUGHT,
THE PRINCE TURNED ROUND TO THE OVERSEER AND FIXED HIS EYES ON HIM,
THE PRINCE WAS LYING ON THE SOFA, LOOKED AT HIM, NOTICED HIS PERTURBED
THE PRINCE WAS SILENT AND LOOKED INDIFFERENT. BUT, WITH THE WOMANLY AND
THE PRINCE WAS SURPRISED THAT SO SIMPLE AN IDEA HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM,
THE PRINCE'S HOUSE DID NOT BELONG TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS FASHIONABLE
THE PRINCE'S TONE WAS SO CALM AND CONFIDENT THAT PRINCESS MARY
THE PRINCE, BUT MADE UP HIS MIND TO ADDRESS HIM NEVERTHELESS.
THE PRINCE, TIED HIS HEAD UP WITH A HANDKERCHIEF THAT THE MOUTH SHOULD
THE PRINCE, WHO WAS IN HIS LARGE STUDY. FROM THE FAR SIDE OF THE HOUSE
THE PRINCE.
THE PRINCESS AND DESSALLES WITH THE LITTLE PRINCE TO BOGUCHAROVO AND
THE PRINCESS AND HASTILY ADJUSTING HIS LORGNETTE, AS IF WITHOUT THIS
THE PRINCESS BENT OVER THE EXERCISE BOOK ON THE TABLE.
THE PRINCESS BLUSHED, AND RAISED HER ARMS WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR.
THE PRINCESS CAME IN. SHE HAD CHANGED HER GOWN FOR A HOUSE DRESS AS
THE PRINCESS CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIM WITHOUT MOVING, AND WITH THE SAME
THE PRINCESS DECIDED TO LEAVE ON THE FIFTEENTH. THE CARES OF PREPARATION
THE PRINCESS DID NOT FALL DOWN OR FAINT. SHE WAS ALREADY PALE, BUT ON
THE PRINCESS DID NOT REPLY. THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE
THE PRINCESS DID SPEAK, HER WORDS WOULD NOT BE FLATTERING TO ANNA
THE PRINCESS GAVE A WRONG ANSWER.
THE PRINCESS GAVE NO REPLY AND DID NOT EVEN SMILE, BUT LEFT THE ROOM AS
THE PRINCESS GAVE ORDERS TO HARNESS FOR HER JOURNEY, THE PEASANTS HAD
THE PRINCESS GLANCED AT HER WATCH AND, SEEING THAT SHE WAS FIVE MINUTES
THE PRINCESS IN A TONE OF ENTREATY.
THE PRINCESS IN THE SAME PETULANTLY PLAYFUL TONE IN WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN
THE PRINCESS LET GO.
THE PRINCESS LISTENED, SMILING.
THE PRINCESS LOOKED AT HIM, NOT GRASPING WHAT HE WAS SAYING, BUT CHEERED
THE PRINCESS LOOKED IN A SCARED WAY AT HER FATHER'S EYES GLITTERING
THE PRINCESS NOTICED ALL THAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HER AND FELT THE
THE PRINCESS PONDERED AWHILE WITH A THOUGHTFUL SMILE AND HER LUMINOUS
THE PRINCESS RESTED HER BARE ROUND ARM ON A LITTLE TABLE AND CONSIDERED
THE PRINCESS ROSE QUICKLY TO MEET HIM AND HELD OUT HER HAND.
THE PRINCESS SAID NOTHING, BUT SUDDENLY HER SHORT DOWNY LIP QUIVERED.
THE PRINCESS SANK HELPLESSLY INTO AN ARMCHAIR BESIDE HER FATHER AND
THE PRINCESS SAW THAT HER FATHER REGARDED THE MATTER WITH DISAPPROVAL,
THE PRINCESS SEEMED TO SEE NOTHING MORE EXTRAORDINARY IN THAT THAN IF HE
THE PRINCESS SMILED AS PEOPLE DO WHO THINK THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE
THE PRINCESS SMILED. SHE ROSE WITH THE SAME UNCHANGING SMILE WITH WHICH
THE PRINCESS STARTED. EVIDENTLY PIERRE'S WORDS TOUCHED HER TO THE QUICK.
THE PRINCESS STOPPED. SIGHS WERE THE ONLY SOUND HEARD IN THE CROWD.
THE PRINCESS TOO HAD PREPARED PROVISIONS FOR PIERRE'S JOURNEY.
THE PRINCESS UNDERSTOOD WHAT NATASHA HAD MEANT BY THE WORDS: "TWO DAYS
THE PRINCESS WAS ABOUT TO REPLY, BUT HER FATHER WOULD NOT LET HER SPEAK
THE PRINCESS WAS APPARENTLY VEXED AT NOT HAVING ANYONE TO BE ANGRY WITH.
THE PRINCESS WENT UP TO THE DOOR, PASSED BY IT WITH A DIGNIFIED AND
THE PRINCESS WISHED TO RISE, BUT THE PRINCE HELD HER BY THE HAND. SHE
THE PRINCESS' CARRIAGES. MEANWHILE HE WENT HIMSELF TO THE POLICE
THE PRINCESS' SORROW AND MAKING HERSELF A PARTNER IN IT. SHE SAID HER
THE PRINCESS, HOLDING HER LITTLE DOG ON HER LAP WITH HER THIN BONY
THE PRINCESS, PICKING UP HER DRESS, WAS TAKING HER SEAT IN THE DARK
THE PRINCESS, WHO HAD A STRAIGHT, RIGID BODY, ABNORMALLY LONG FOR HER
THE PRINCESS, WHO HAD NEVER LIKED PIERRE AND HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY
THE PRINCESS. AT LAST AN OLD, CROSS LOOKING FOOTMAN CAME AND ANNOUNCED
THE PRISONERS HAD SEEN IN FRONT OF THEM DURING THE FIRST DAYS WAS
THE PRISONERS OF WAR. WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM, PIERRE
THE PRISONERS WERE BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE BATTERY AND AMONG THEM WAS
THE PRISONERS WERE PLACED IN A CERTAIN ORDER, ACCORDING TO THE LIST
THE PROBLEM IS THAT REGARDING MAN AS A SUBJECT OF OBSERVATION
THE PROCESS OF REGENERATION HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE IN HIM, AND I RUSHED
THE PROCESS OF THE FLIGHT AND DISINTEGRATION OF THE FRENCH ARMY WENT ON
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR. THIS COMMITTEE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
THE PROJECT GUTENBERG LITERARY ARCHIVE FOUNDATION IS A NON PROFIT
THE PROMISED LAND FOR THE FRENCH DURING THEIR ADVANCE HAD BEEN MOSCOW,
THE PROOFS HE DEDUCED TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH STOOPING
THE PROPORTION OF FREEDOM TO INEVITABILITY DECREASES AND INCREASES
THE PROPRIETIES--A DEPUTATION.
THE PROVISIONS, OF WHICH (ACCORDING TO THE FRENCH HISTORIANS) THERE WERE
THE PRUSSIANS ARE UP IN ARMS NOW. THE AUSTRIANS, YOU SEE, ARE PUTTING
THE PUBLICAN WAS FIGHTING ONE OF THE SMITHS AT THE DOOR, AND WHEN THE
THE PURCHASER WAS GOING ON SATISFACTORILY, AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO KEEP
THE PURSUIT, THE BARRING OF THE WAY, OR ANY OTHER PARTICULAR CONDITIONS.
THE QUARTERS OCCUPIED BY THE FRENCH WERE OTHER REGIONS STILL UNEXPLORED
THE QUARTETTE, "THE BROOK," WITH WHICH EVERYONE WAS DELIGHTED. THEN
THE QUESTION AROSE WHETHER THE TROOPS WERE TO BE IN MARCHING ORDER OR
THE QUESTION FOR ME TO THINK OF MARRYING HER. AND IT MUST NEEDS HAPPEN
THE QUESTION IS THAT OF SAVING RUSSIA. IS IT BETTER TO GIVE UP MOSCOW
THE QUESTION OF SELECTION. PIERRE DISTURBED THE SYMMETRY BY MOVING A
THE QUESTION THAT HAD PERTURBED PIERRE ON THE MOZHAYSK HILL AND ALL
THE QUESTION WAS NO LONGER WHETHER THIS WAS POSSIBLE, BUT ONLY WHICH WAS
THE QUESTION.
THE QUESTION: HOW DID INDIVIDUALS MAKE NATIONS ACT AS THEY WISHED AND BY
THE QUESTIONS THAT HAD HAUNTED HIM, BUT BECAUSE HIS CONCEPTION OF HER
THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BALD HILLS PRESENTED
THE RAEVSKI REDOUBT, OR THE KNOLL BATTERY, BUT PIERRE PAID NO SPECIAL
THE RAIN HAD STOPPED, AND ONLY THE MIST WAS FALLING AND DROPS FROM
THE RAISED HOOD OF PRINCE ANDREW'S CALECHE. SHE DID NOT KNOW WHO WAS
THE RANK OF MAJOR, AND ROSTOV, WHO HAD ALREADY DRUNK ENOUGH, AT THE END
THE RANKS OF OBSCURE OFFICERS AND OFFER HIM THE FIRST STEP TO FAME!
THE RANKS OF THE INFANTRY DISAPPEARED AMID THE SMOKE BUT THEIR
THE RANKS WOULD BE THE BEST THAT COULD BE HOPED FOR.
THE RANKS, AND ABOVE ALL BEING UNABLE TO SEE ANYTHING IN FRONT OR AROUND
THE RANKS. A MOROSE SOLDIER MARCHING ON THE LEFT TURNED HIS EYES ON
THE RAPIDITY OF ITS MOVEMENT, AND A CONVINCING PROOF OF THIS IS THE
THE RAPIDITY OF THE RUSSIAN PURSUIT WAS JUST AS DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR ARMY
THE RAPIDITY OF WHICH WAS UNPARALLELED FOR SUCH A TIME OF THE YEAR.
THE READING OF NOVELS, THE DISTRIBUTION OF AWARDS, HIS CORRESPONDENCE
THE REALMS OF RUSSIA WITH DEATH-BEARING TERRORS; HUMBLE FAITH, THE SLING
THE REARGUARD STOOD WITH A STAFF OFFICER, SCANNING THE COUNTRY THROUGH
THE REASON OF THAT SADNESS AND SUDDENLY BEGAN TO CRY.
THE REASON WHY THE LIFE AND ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVED CENTURIES AGO
THE RECEPTION HALL: MICHAEL IVANOVICH, MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE, PRINCESS
THE RECEPTION ROOM FAMILIAR TO PIERRE, WITH TWO ITALIAN WINDOWS OPENING
THE RECEPTION ROOM, WHERE HE FOUND SOME TEN OFFICERS AND GENERALS.
THE RECOGNITION OF MAN'S FREE WILL AS SOMETHING CAPABLE OF INFLUENCING
THE RECRUITING, GRANTED BY THE EMPEROR. IF I HAD BEEN TWO HOURS LATE
THE RED, STOUT NESVITSKI, LAY ON A BED WITH HIS ARMS UNDER HIS HEAD,
THE RED-NOSED CAPTAIN TIMOKHIN, FORMERLY DOLOKHOV'S SQUADRON COMMANDER,
THE REDDISH LYUBIM RUSHED FORWARD FROM BEHIND MILKA, SPRANG IMPETUOUSLY
THE REDNESS OF WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY DUE TO INTEMPERANCE, AND HIS MOUTH
THE REFORM OF THE ARMY REGULATIONS TO THE EMPEROR PERSONALLY, BUT THE
THE REFORMATION THE PEOPLES MASSACRED ONE ANOTHER, NOR WHY DURING THE
THE REGIMENT BROKE UP INTO COMPANIES, WHICH WENT TO THEIR APPOINTED
THE REGIMENT BUT WAS NOT LIKED; ROSTOV ESPECIALLY DETESTED HIM AND WAS
THE REGIMENT KUTUZOV HAD REVIEWED AT BRAUNAU AND IN WHICH DOLOKHOV WAS
THE REGIMENT UNDER A HAIL OF BULLETS WHICH FELL AROUND, BUT FORTUNATELY
THE REGIMENT WAS ALSO A HOME, AND AS UNALTERABLY DEAR AND PRECIOUS AS
THE REGIMENT WITH THESE GENTLEMEN, AND I CONSIDER THAT ON US TOMORROW'S
THE REGIMENT, AND HOW SATISFIED HIS FATHER WAS WITH HIM. BERG EVIDENTLY
THE REGIMENT. THE HORSE OF AN AMMUNITION CART PUT ITS LEG OVER A TRACE.
THE REGIMENTAL ADJUTANT CAME IN AND CONFIRMED THE NEWS BROUGHT BY
THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER SOUGHT OUT DOLOKHOV IN THE RANKS AND, REINING
THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT BE BLAMED FOR THIS AND DID
THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER, FLUSHING, RAN TO HIS HORSE, SEIZED THE STIRRUP
THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER, GOING UP TO THE LINE HIMSELF, ORDERED THE
THE REGIMENTAL DOCTOR, WHEN HE CAME, SAID IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO
THE REGIMENTS AND WAS ANNOYED AT THE IRREGULARITY OF A MOVEMENT. WITH A
THE REMAINS OF LANGERON'S AND DOKHTUROV'S MINGLED FORCES WERE CROWDING
THE REMAINS OF OUR REGIMENT WHICH HAD BEEN IN ACTION RAPIDLY FORMED UP
THE RENOVATION OF THE EUROPEAN WORLD DEPENDED ON ATTILA'S CAPRICE. THE
THE REPLIES THIS THEORY GIVES TO HISTORICAL QUESTIONS ARE LIKE THE
THE REPORT OF MUSKETRY.
THE REPORT WHICH HAD BEEN CIRCULATED THAT THE AUSTRIANS HAD BEEN BEATEN
THE REPORTS MOST FLATTERING TO OUR ARMY WERE CIRCULATED. IN THE FRENCH
THE REPORTS OF THE COSSACKS THERE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN NOBODY--THERE WERE
THE REPROACHES PRINCESS MARY HAD MENTALLY ADDRESSED TO HER. "BESIDES,
THE REPUTATION OF BEING THE MOST HONORABLE AND DISINTERESTED OF CRANKS.
THE RESOUNDING STRAINS OF THE POLONAISE:
THE RESPECT THE GUARDS SHOWED HIM--ENTERED THE COACH HOUSE WHERE THE
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THAT HAPPENS. A SOVEREIGN SHOULD NOT BE WITH
THE REST OF THE ARMY MERELY LOST SOME HUNDREDS OF MEN USELESSLY.
THE REST WAS NIGHT IN WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF DISCIPLINE CANNOT BE
THE REST."
THE RESULT WAS A COMPROMISE WHICH WAS INEVITABLE: A SMALL DETACHMENT WAS
THE RESULTANT OF VARIOUS FORCES, AND THEN HIS POWER IS ITSELF A FORCE
THE RESULTING FORCE. TO DEFINE AND EXPRESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
THE RESULTS OF THE CROSSING WERE MUCH LESS DISASTROUS TO THE FRENCH--IN
THE RETREAT FROM MALO-YAROSLAVETS WHEN HE HAD A FREE ROAD INTO A
THE RETREAT OF THE FRIGHTENED BONAPARTE.
THE REVOLVING PULLEYS WHIRR WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THEIR MOVEMENT, BUT A
THE REWARDS SENT TO THE ARMY ARE INNUMERABLE. THOUGH HE IS A GERMAN--I

THE RHETOR CLEARED HIS THROAT, CROSSED HIS GLOVED HANDS ON HIS BREAST,
THE RHINE AND THE COLOSSEUM. THE CABMEN HE MET AND THEIR PASSENGERS,
THE RIBS AND TELLING HIM TO HOLD HIS HAND UP. SOLDIERS SCATTERED OVER
THE RIGHT FLANK AND THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY ADVANCING, WERE ENGAGED
THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE PREOBRAZHENSK BATTALION AND CAME STRAIGHT UP TO
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT.
THE RIGHT POSITION OPPOSITE THE OTHER; HER FACE ASSUMED A SERIOUS
THE RIGHT SIDE GLITTERED IN THE SUNLIGHT, WET AND SHINY AND SCARCELY
THE RIGHT SOUNDED OFTENER AND NEARER. AS SOON AS TUSHIN WITH HIS GUNS,
THE RIGHT STOOD OUR INFANTRY IN A DENSE COLUMN: THEY WERE THE RESERVE.
THE RIGHT THEY WILL EXPOSE A FLANK TO ME. SOLDIERS! I WILL MYSELF DIRECT
THE RIGHT THING NOW WAS, IF NOT TO RETIRE FROM THE SERVICE, AT ANY RATE

THE ROAD, AND HEARD HIS FRIEND THE CAPTAIN REPRIMAND AND THREATEN TO
THE ROAD. THE MEN SAT HUDDLED UP TRYING NOT TO STIR, SO AS TO WARM THE

THE ROOM FOR A LONG TIME, NO LONGER PIERCING AN IMAGINARY FOE WITH
THE ROOM IN SILENCE, AND THEN, SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY, WENT UP TO
THE ROOM NEXT TO THE ONE WHERE THE PRINCE LAY. SEVERAL TIMES, WAKING UP,
THE ROOM THE OLD PRINCE, LOOKING UNEASILY ROUND, THREW DOWN HIS NAPKIN
THE ROOM WAS CROWDED WITH SMALL PIECES OF FURNITURE, WHATNOTS,
THE ROOM WAS IN BLACK DARKNESS, ONLY A SMALL LAMP WAS BURNING INSIDE
THE ROOM WHERE KHVOSTIKOV AND MAKARIN WERE SITTING.
THE ROOM WHERE THE WITNESSES WERE SITTING, THROUGH THE STUDY TO THE ROOM

THE ROOM, STEPPING BRISKLY TO THE FRONT OF THE CROWD OF GENTRY.
THE ROOM, TO THE CORNER DARKENED BY THE ICONS THAT HUNG THERE.

THINKING ABOUT THE STRANGENESS OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED.
THINKING ABOUT YOU. WHY ARE YOU GOING?"

THINKING ABOUT? WHY IS SHE SO GLAD?"
THINKING ALOUD IN HIS WIFE'S PRESENCE NOW THAT THEY HAD MADE IT UP.
THINKING HE COULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN SUCH A MANNER ONLY BECAUSE

THINKING OF THAT.
THINKING OF TILL NOW?"
THINKING WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING (WHICH SEEMED TO THEM INCOMPREHENSIBLE),
THINKING, MECHANICALLY BROKE THE SEAL AND READ A LOVE LETTER FROM

THIRD COMPANY HE SUDDENLY STOPPED. HIS SUITE, NOT HAVING EXPECTED THIS,
THIRD COMPANY!"
THIRD COUPLE. BORIS, COOLLY LOOKING AT HELENE'S DAZZLING BARE SHOULDERS

THIRTY YEARS, AND UNDERSTANDING THE MOOD HE WAS IN EXPECTED A PLEASANT
THIRTY-FIVE FEET LONG AND SEVEN FEET HIGH, MOVED FORWARD ALONG THE
THIRTY-SECOND MILITARY DIVISION, OF BREMEN, OF HAMBURG, AND SO ON: IT
THIS ACTION WAS SO UNLIKE HER USUAL COMPOSURE AND THE FEAR DEPICTED
THIS ACTIVE OLD SERVANT WAS UNPACKING THE TRAVELER'S CANTEEN AND
THIS AGREEMENT FOR KEEPING THE PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM NAME ASSOCIATED WITH
THIS AIM, WE OCCUPY OURSELVES EITHER WITH THE MYSTERY WHICH IN OUR
THIS AND ALL ASSOCIATED FILES OF VARIOUS FORMATS WILL BE FOUND IN:
THIS AND GUESSED ITS REASON.
THIS ASSUMPTION IS ALL THE MORE NATURAL AND INEVITABLE BECAUSE, WATCHING
THIS BATTLE, WHICH CONSISTED IN THE CAPTURE OF A FRENCH SQUADRON, WAS
THIS BEING THE FIELD MARSHAL'S FRAME OF MIND HE WAS NATURALLY REGARDED
THIS BIG, STOUT, QUIET MAN, WONDERING HOW SUCH A CLUMSY, MODEST FELLOW
THIS BIT OF BOASTFUL PATRIOTISM SLIPPED OUT AT THE END.
THIS BLACK-EYED, WIDE-MOUTHED GIRL, NOT PRETTY BUT FULL OF LIFE--WITH
THIS BOMBARDMENT.
THIS BONE--A BILL FOR THIRTY THOUSAND RUBLES--TO THE POOR PRINCESS THAT

THIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SOURCE OF SELF-COGNITION QUITE APART FROM AND
THIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISMANAGEMENT BECAME A GENERAL CONVICTION, BUT AS
THIS CONTRADICTION ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT MILITARY SCIENCE ASSUMES

THIS CRAZY WORLD."
THIS CURIOUS CONTRADICTION IS NOT ACCIDENTAL. NOT ONLY DOES IT OCCUR AT
THIS DEBAUCHERY, DISSIPATION, AND THE REST OF IT!"
THIS DESPERATE AND PROVOCATIVE PROPOSITION HIS EXTREME YOUTH AND HIS
THIS DIMINUTIVE EXPRESSING HIS AFFECTION AND THE HOPES HE PLACED ON THIS
THIS DOOR LED INTO A BACK ANTEROOM. AN OLD MAN, A SERVANT OF THE
THIS DOUBT TO HIM. "NOW WHO COULD DECIDE WHETHER HE IS REALLY CLEVERER
THIS DREADFUL, INEXTRICABLE POSITION!" HE SUDDENLY BEGAN TO PRAY. "YES,
THIS EBOOK IS FOR THE USE OF ANYONE ANYWHERE AT NO COST AND WITH
THIS EBOOK IS FOR THE USE OF ANYONE ANYWHERE AT NO COST AND WITH
THIS END?" THOUGHT ROSTOV, LOOKING AT THE CHANGING SHADOWS BEFORE
THIS ENEMY OF DECISIVE ACTION, GAVE BATTLE AT BORODINO, INVESTING THE
THIS EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ITS JUSTIFICATION IN THE NECESSITY FOR A
THIS EXPECTATION DID NOT UPSET THE REGULAR ROUTINE OF LIFE IN THE
THIS EXTRAORDINARY GATHERING NOT ONLY OF NOBLES BUT ALSO OF THE
THIS FAMILY GATHERING SEEMED HUMILIATING TO NATASHA--AS IF THERE WERE
THIS FIRST LONG CONVERSATION WITH SPERANSKI ONLY STRENGTHENED IN PRINCE
THIS FORCE AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS. IN THEIR NARRATION
THIS FORTIFIED CAMP CONSTRUCTED BY PFUEL, AND TILL THEN CONSIDERED
THIS GENERAL DECEPTION WHICH EVERYONE ACCEPTS, ACCUSTOMED AS HE WAS TO
THIS GREAT GRIEF; THAT SHE FELT HERSELF BLAMELESS IN REGARD TO EVERYONE,
THIS GUARDSMAN WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BOWLED ROSTOV AND HIS BEDOUIN OVER
THIS HE REPLIED THAT ONE SHOULD NOT DEPRIVE A WIFE OF ONE'S EMBRACES AND
THIS HE STARTED FOR THE COUNTRY NEXT DAY.
THIS HEART, SO KIND AND GENEROUS? SAY 'PERHAPS'... THE FUTURE IS SO
THIS HUSSAR, WITH A GRAVE FACE AND WITHOUT A SMILE OR A CHANGE IN THE
THIS IDEAL OF GLORY AND GRANDEUR--WHICH CONSISTS NOT MERELY IN
THIS INSTANT!" THOUGHT ROSTOV.
THIS INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE TWO EMPERORS, AND HAVING SUCCEEDED IN THIS,
THIS IS A DINNER FOR RECREATION, WITH NOT A WORD ABOUT BUSINESS!" AND
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! HALF THE MEN HAVE DISPERSED."
THIS IS REALLY BEYOND ANYTHING, MY DEAR COUNT," SAID SHE TO COUNT ROSTOV
THIS IS WHAT I WAS PROUD OF! I THEN THOUGHT THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
THIS IS WHAT THE ARMY AUTHORITIES WERE REPORTING:
THIS IS WHAT WE'LL DO: I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND, AN ADJUTANT GENERAL AND AN
THIS KEPT HIM IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT BORDERING ON INSANITY.
THIS KUTUZOV KNEW WELL.
THIS LETTER HAD NOT YET BEEN PRESENTED TO THE EMPEROR WHEN BARCLAY, ONE
THIS LETTER TOUCHED NICHOLAS. HE HAD THAT COMMON SENSE OF A
THIS LETTER WAS BROUGHT TO PIERRE'S HOUSE WHEN HE WAS ON THE FIELD OF
THIS LIFE I DID NOT AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND."
THIS LIFE TEMPORARILY; BUT THEN HE WAS SHOCKED BY THE THOUGHT OF HOW
THIS LIFE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND, HER CHILDREN, LITTLE NICHOLAS, AND ALL
THIS LONGING TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES, TO MANEUVER, TO OVERTHROW, AND
THIS LOVE AFFAIR WHICH MIGHT HINDER NICHOLAS FROM MAKING A BRILLIANT
THIS LOWEST-GRADE GREETING, A LOOK OF ANXIETY AND FEAR, AS AT THE SIGHT
THIS MAN AND THAT MAN, DID NOT EXECUTE SUCH AND SUCH MANEUVERS...
THIS MAN IS STILL NEEDED TO JUSTIFY THE FINAL COLLECTIVE ACT.
THIS MAN RECEIVES A DAUGHTER OF THE CAESARS INTO HIS BED; THE POPE, THE
THIS MAN, BENT DOUBLE, RUSHED PAST THE TRADESMAN AND THE OFFICER. THE
THIS MAN. WHEN SHE TURNED AWAY SHE FEARED HE MIGHT SEIZE HER FROM BEHIND
THIS MATTER IS MERELY TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE ILLUMINATION
THIS MEANT THAT TIKHON WAS NOT HANDING HIM THE WAISTCOAT HE WANTED.
THIS MEANT TWO STOCKINGS, WHICH BY A SECRET PROCESS KNOWN ONLY TO
THIS MODERN BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS, UNKNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS, WHEN DEALING
THIS MOMENT OF HAPPY, RAPTUROUS EXCITEMENT. SHE GAZED AT HIM, NOT TAKING
THIS MOVED, OR SEEMED TO MOVE, AS THE SMOKE AND MIST SPREAD OUT OVER
THIS MOVEMENT MEANS, WHAT CAUSED IT, AND WHAT FORCE PRODUCED THESE
THIS MOVEMENT OF THE TRANSPORT AND OF THE WHOLE ARMY, HAD TO REMAIN
THIS MOVEMENT, BY WHAT LAWS WAS IT GOVERNED? ASKS THE MIND OF MAN.
THIS MURDER? EITHER I SHALL KILL HIM, OR HE WILL HIT ME IN THE HEAD,
THIS MURDERER AND VILLAIN! WE ALONE MUST AVENGE THE BLOOD OF THE JUST
THIS NAME DAY OF HERS HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST SHE HAD EVER HAD.
THIS NEW SORROW BROUGHT THEM STILL CLOSER TO ONE ANOTHER. PRINCESS MARY
THIS NEW, TERRIBLE STATE OF THINGS BEGIN? WHAT MARKED THE CHANGE? I SAT
THIS NEWS STIFLED ALL SYMPATHY FOR THE MAN THEY BOTH LIKED.
THIS OF THEE, BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE DO LET THE OLD WOLF COME MY WAY AND
THIS OFFICER BEGAN VISITING PIERRE, AND THE PRINCESS USED TO MAKE FUN OF
THIS ONE."
THIS OPINION, BUT AS SOON AS HE EXPRESSED IT KARP AND OTHERS ATTACKED
THIS OR THAT FIGURE COMES OUT NOT BECAUSE THE COLOR WAS LAID ON FROM
THIS OR THAT? WHY DID HE NOT TAKE UP A POSITION BEFORE REACHING FILI?
THIS PARTY BELONGED THE FOREIGN NOBLES, WOLZOGEN, WINTZINGERODE, AND
THIS PARTY WERE THOSE WHO HAD DEMANDED AN ADVANCE FROM VILNA INTO POLAND
THIS PARTY, WROTE A LETTER TO THE EMPEROR WHICH ARAKCHEEV AND BALASHEV
THIS PASSAGE AND WILL HOLD HER BACK BY FORCE AND WILL AND NOT LET THE
THIS PEASANT, IT WAS REPORTED TO HIM THAT TIKHON HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF
THIS PIERRE WAS VERY SENSITIVE.
THIS PLACE WHICH TEEMED WITH LIFE, NOR COULD HE EVEN DISTINGUISH OUR
THIS POETIC AND PURE INTIMACY, WERE WHAT MY HEART NEEDED. BUT ENOUGH OF
THIS PROBLEM IS ONLY SOLVABLE IF WE CEASE ARBITRARILY TO SUBSTITUTE
THIS PROCRASTINATOR KUTUZOV, WHOSE MOTTO WAS "PATIENCE AND TIME,"
THIS PROGRESSION TO INFINITY, DO WE REACH A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM.
THIS QUESTION, OBSERVED:
THIS RED-HAIRED MAN WAS NEITHER A SERGEANT NOR A CORPORAL, BUT BEING
THIS REDOUBT CONSISTED OF A KNOLL, ON THREE SIDES OF WHICH TRENCHES HAD
THIS REFINED SELECTION OF SOCIETY ANNA PAVLOVNA'S RECEPTIONS WERE
THIS RELATION OF THE COMMANDER TO THOSE HE COMMANDS IS JUST WHAT IS
THIS RELATION OF THE MEN WHO COMMAND TO THOSE THEY COMMAND IS WHAT
THIS REPLY IS QUITE SATISFACTORY IF WE BELIEVE THAT THE POWER WAS GIVEN
THIS REPLY OF BALASHEV'S, WHICH HINTED AT THE RECENT DEFEATS OF THE
THIS RESEMBLANCE HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY UGLY. HIS FEATURES WERE LIKE HIS
THIS SAME IDEA. THIS IDEA IS LE BIEN PUBLIC, THE HYPOTHETICAL WELFARE OF
THIS SAME IRRESOLUTE AND UNDISCERNING DOKHTUROV--KUTUZOV HASTENING TO
THIS SECRECY?"
THIS SHORT MAN HAD ON A WHITE LEATHER APRON WHICH COVERED HIS CHEST AND
THIS SIDE OR IN THAT WAY, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS LAID ON FROM ALL SIDES OVER
THIS SILENCE WAS BROKEN BY ONE OF THE BRETHREN, WHO LED PIERRE UP TO THE
THIS SMALL CIRCULAR DRAWING ROOM WITH ITS MIRRORS AND LITTLE TABLES.
THIS SO STRONGLY THAT THE OUTWARD AND TERRIBLE SIDE OF DEATH DID NOT
THIS SPEECH NOT ONLY MADE A STRONG IMPRESSION, BUT CREATED EXCITEMENT IN
THIS SPITE INCREASED STILL MORE WHEN, ON CALLING OVER THE ROLL OF
THIS STRANGE INCIDENT, AND THEN SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS WENT TO THE DOOR
THIS STRANGE, UNEXPECTED HAPPINESS OF MEETING AGAIN THE VERY MAN SHE HAD
THIS STRONG, BRAVE MAN, THIS MODEL SON AND OFFICER THAT, JUDGING BY THIS
THIS SUBJECT WHICH IRRITATED DENISOV. "NOW, WHY HAVE YOU KEPT THIS LAD?"
THIS TERRIBLE CUDGEL WHICH REGARDLESS OF THE RULES OF MILITARY SCIENCE

THIS THOUGHT TO NO ONE BUT TO HER CONFESSOR, FATHER AKINFI, THE MONK,
THIS TIME, HE REPEATEDLY SAYS THAT HE WAS THEN ACTUATED BY TWO IMPORTANT

THIS UNEXPECTED AND, AS IT SEEMED TO NICHOLAS, QUITE VOLUNTARY LETTER
THIS UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION MERELY FLITTED OVER THE YOUNG AND HAPPY FACE
THIS UNSHAKABLE, IRREFUTABLE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM, UNCONTROLLED BY
THIS VERY DAY," HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF.
THIS VERY SENTENCE ABOUT COUNTESS ZUBOVA AND THIS SAME LAUGH PRINCE

THIS VIEW WAS VERY GENERAL IN THE UPPER ARMY CIRCLES AND FOUND SUPPORT
THIS WAITING AND I SHALL CRY IN A MINUTE!" AND SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THE
THIS WAR WAS THAT THE OLD PRINCE NEVER SPOKE OF IT, DID NOT RECOGNIZE
THIS WAS KONOVNITSYN.
THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH. SHE KNEW THAT, AND ASKED HERSELF, "WHAT NEXT?"
THIS WAS NOT SO BUT THAT ON THE CONTRARY THE FRENCH HAD RUN AWAY. HE
THIS WAS QUITE CORRECT ON THE TWENTY-FOURTH OF JULY. BUT ON THE
THIS WAS QUITE TRUE, BUT THE COUNT, THE COUNTESS, AND NATASHA LOOKED
THIS WAS RAEVSKI, WHO HAD SPENT THE WHOLE DAY AT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
THIS WAS SAID BY THE UNDERSIZED NAPOLEON, LOOKING UP STRAIGHT INTO
THIS WAS THE COUNT'S FAVORITE DANCE, WHICH HE HAD DANCED IN HIS YOUTH.
THIS WAS THE REDOUBT, AS YET UNNAMED, WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME KNOWN AS
THIS WAS TRUE. THE ARCHITECT HAD TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY, AND

THIS WOMAN (WHO WAS "UNCLE'S" HOUSEKEEPER) TROD VERY LIGHTLY. SHE WENT
THIS WOMAN, WHO WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO KIND. HELENE FOR HER PART WAS
THIS WOULD HAPPEN."
THIS WOUNDED MAN WAS PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI.
THIS YOUNG JACOBIN WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE AS HIS WORDS SUGGESTED. ALL WERE
THIS! THE CHIEF NEWS, ABOUT WHICH ALL MOSCOW GOSSIPS, IS THE DEATH OF
THIS, AND HE RECEIVED TWO DECORATIONS FOR THE FINNISH WAR ALSO. IN
THIS, BUT IN THE SECOND YEAR OF HIS MARRIAGE HIS VIEW OF THAT FORM OF
THIS, BUT PRINCE ANDREW WAS FIRM. HE CAME EVERY DAY TO THE ROSTOVS',
THIS, SHOWING ALL THE NEWS WE HAVE HAD OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE AUSTRIAN

THIS," CRIED PRINCE ANDREW IN A SHRILL VOICE THAT SEEMED TO ESCAPE HIM
THIS--SHEER ROBBERY! IF YOU PLEASE, COULD NOT GUARDS BE PLACED IF ONLY
THIS.
THIS. "WITHOUT A NAME AND WITHOUT MEANS... AND IT REALLY..." BUT HE
THIS. THIS SECRET CORRESPONDENCE... HOW COULD YOU LET HIM GO SO FAR?"
THIS: "IT WAS AN AWFUL SIGHT--CHILDREN ABANDONED, SOME IN THE FLAMES...
THIS? BUT SHE DOES DANCE SPLENDIDLY."
THIS?" BUT THESE DOUBTS ONLY LASTED A MOMENT. PIERRE GLANCED AT THE
THOSE CONCEPTIONS.
THOSE CONFINED THERE WERE AWAITING A DECISION WHICH MIGHT COME ANY DAY
THOSE CONFLICTING OPINIONS, WERE ABLE TO TAKE A DETACHED VIEW OF WHAT
THOSE DAYS, THE ABSENCE OF WINE AND CIGARS, HIS DIRTY UNCHANGED LINEN,
THOSE DEFENDED BY TWO SUCH BRAVE ARMIES MAY FEEL ASSURED OF VICTORY."
THOSE DOUBTS WAS TO BE FOUND WITHIN HIMSELF. BUT NOW HE FELT THAT
THOSE DREADFUL MOMENTS HE HAD LIVED THROUGH AT THE EXECUTIONS HAD AS IT
THOSE DREADFUL, WICKED TEMPTATIONS, WAS A TORMENT OF JOY AND TERROR.
THOSE EYES, FILLED WITH HAPPY TEARS, GAZED AT HIM TIMIDLY,
THOSE FIRST STEPS. BOTH HAD CHANGED GREATLY SINCE THEY LAST MET AND BOTH
THOSE FORESTS AND FIELDS, THE BRIGHT, OSCILLATING, LIMITLESS DISTANCE
THOSE HANDS WITH THEIR SHORT REDDISH FINGERS AND HAIRY WRISTS, WHICH
THOSE HE TERMED THEY), AND HE HEARD THOSE PEOPLE, ANATOLE AND DOLOKHOV,
THOSE HUMAN WILLS, MAN'S MIND POSTULATES ARBITRARY AND DISCONNECTED
THOSE IN CLOSEST ATTENDANCE ON THE EMPEROR, WENT UP TO HIM AND CONTRARY
THOSE IN FRONT HAD HALTED. ALL REMAINED WHERE THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF
THOSE INIMITABLE AND UNTEACHABLE RUSSIAN ONES THAT "UNCLE" HAD EXPECTED
THOSE KURAGINS AND LEADING THAT SORT OF LIFE. IT SUITS YOU SO BADLY--ALL
THOSE LEADERS?
THOSE OF BALD HILLS. THEY DIFFERED FROM THEM IN SPEECH, DRESS, AND
THOSE OF HIGHER RANKS IN THE ORDER.  3. MORALITY.  4. LOVE OF MANKIND.
THOSE OLD MEN! EH?"
THOSE ON FOOT, COLLAPSED IN A GREAT MASS, AND SOME FORTY MEN WHO WERE ON
THOSE RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN HIMSELF AND HE HAD RARE SKILL IN
THOSE STANDING BEHIND NOTICED WHAT A SPEAKER OMITTED TO SAY AND HASTENED
THOSE USED IN CHURCHES. TWO OF THE BROTHERS LED PIERRE UP TO THE ALTAR,
THOSE WHO COMMITTED THEM DID NOT AT THE TIME REGARD AS BEING CRIMES.
THOSE WHO EXAMINE THE ACTIONS OF ANY GOVERNMENT HAVE ALWAYS SAID SINCE
THOSE WHO LAGGED BEHIND. PIERRE FELT THAT THAT FATAL FORCE WHICH HAD
THOSE WHO STOOD IN THE MOST PROMINENT POSITION--THE HEROES OF HISTORY.
THOSE WHO TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND TO TAKE
THOSE WHO WERE ABLE TO GET AWAY WERE GOING OF THEIR OWN ACCORD, THOSE
THOSE WHO WERE DISPUTING HONESTLY.
THOSE WHO WERE GUIDING HIM.
THOSE WHO WERE HOLDING HIM UNDER THE ARMPITS, AND OF HIS GRAY, CURLY,
THOSE WHO WERE IN THE DIMLY LIT RECEPTION ROOM SPOKE IN NERVOUS
THOSE WHO, AS HE IMAGINED, UNDERSTOOD THE REAL MEANING OF LIFE (THAT
THOSE WILLS FIRST TOLERATED AND THEN DESTROYED THEM.
THOSE WORDS KUTUZOV LOOKED ROUND. HE WAS LISTENING TO THE GENERAL'S
THOSE WORDS, THAT IS TO SAY, SO UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT IF ANY SENSELESS

THREE FORMS.
THREE GREAT SORROWS OF HIS LIFE HELD HIS ATTENTION IN PARTICULAR: HIS
THREE HOURS. EH?"
THREE LARGE ROOMS WERE ASSIGNED TO THEM IN THE MONASTERY HOSTELRY, ONE
THREE MONTHS AGO, DRAW FRESH MORAL STRENGTH FROM YOUR LOOK, SO GENTLE,
THREE OFFICERS OF DENISOV'S BAND WERE CONVERTING A DOOR INTO A TABLETOP.
THREE OFFICERS QUITE EASILY, BUT ZHERKOV, PUSHING NESVITSKI ASIDE WITH
THREE PARTS OF THAT ARMY WERE SHARPLY DISTINGUISHED: KUTUZOV'S FIGHTING
THREE ROANS AND DOZHOYVEYKO, HIS QUARTERMASTER, AND TO WONDER ANXIOUSLY
THREE SERVICES IN THEIR OWN HOUSE, BUT AS AGRAFENA IVANOVNA DID, BY
THREE SIDES. THE MOST VIGOROUS ATTACK CAME FROM AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE,
THREE TENTS WITH FLAPS TURNED BACK, PITCHED AT THE EDGE OF A BIRCH WOOD.
THREE TIMES AND NATASHA FELL ILL FROM DESPAIR, PIERRE ONE DAY TOLD HER
THREE WEEKS AFTER THE LAST EVENING HE HAD SPENT WITH THE ROSTOVS, PRINCE
THREE WEEKS OF THEIR JOURNEY AND LIFE AT YAROSLAVL.
THREE WEEKS PASSED IN THIS WAY. NATASHA HAD NO DESIRE TO GO OUT ANYWHERE

THROWN BACK. HIS WHOLE SHORT CORPULENT FIGURE WITH BROAD THICK
THROWN DOWN THEIR MUSKETS AND RUN. DOLOKHOV, RUNNING BESIDE TIMOKHIN,

TIDINESS AND GOOD MANAGEMENT. SOME DOMESTIC SERFS PIERRE MET, IN REPLY
TIED ROUND HIS HEAD, WAS STRONGER. HE RAISED HIS COMPANION AND SAID
TIGHTER. THE FRENCHMAN WAS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING, WHEN JUST ABOVE THEIR
TIKHON CALLED AND, HAVING PRAISED HIM FOR HIS ACTIVITY, SAID A FEW WORDS
TIKHON DID NOT LIKE RIDING, AND ALWAYS WENT ON FOOT, NEVER LAGGING
TIKHON FOLLOWED BEHIND AND PETYA HEARD THE COSSACKS LAUGHING WITH HIM
TIKHON KNEW HIS MASTER'S HABIT OF SOMETIMES THINKING ALOUD, AND
TIKHON KNEW THAT NEITHER THE SON'S ARRIVAL NOR ANY OTHER UNUSUAL EVENT
TIKHON READILY JOINED.
TIKHON SCRATCHED HIS BACK WITH ONE HAND AND HIS HEAD WITH THE OTHER,
TIKHON SHCHERBATY WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDISPENSABLE MEN IN THEIR BAND.
TIKHON TO ASK MARY BOGDANOVNA WHAT NEWS.--"SAY ONLY THAT 'THE PRINCE
TIKHON WENT AND TOLD THE PRINCE.
TIKHON, BUT ASKED SEVERAL TIMES WHETHER HIS SON HAD GONE. NEXT DAY,
TIKHON, LIKE ALL GOOD VALETS, INSTINCTIVELY KNEW THE DIRECTION OF HIS

TIKHON, UNDERSTANDING HIM, WIPED AWAY THE TEARS.
TIKHON, WHO AT FIRST DID ROUGH WORK, LAYING CAMPFIRES, FETCHING WATER,

TILL TEN O'CLOCK.
TILL THAT MOMENT HE HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF KURAGIN, ALL HIS UNEXPENDED

TILL THEN. THEIR POWERS OF REASONING, FEELING, AND OBSERVING IMMEDIATELY
TILL TWO IN THE AFTERNOON AND BORE AWAY WITH THEM THE WOUNDED AND THE
TILSIT TO SEE THE EMPEROR.
TILSIT.
TILSIT. BORIS DRUBETSKOY HAD ASKED THE IMPORTANT PERSONAGE ON WHOM HE
TILTED TO ONE SIDE, DISCLOSED HIS CURLED AND POMADED HAIR BESPRINKLED
TILTING YET FURTHER BACK. "WHY IS IT SO LONG?" THOUGHT PIERRE. IT SEEMED
TIME A BALL FLEW PAST. ROSTOV ON THE LEFT FLANK, MOUNTED ON HIS ROOK--A
TIME ALL THAT PURE, SPIRITUAL, INWARD TRAVAIL THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD
TIME AND DOES NOT CONDESCEND TO PREPARE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY BUT IS SURE
TIME ARE WANTED. KAMENSKI SENT SOLDIERS TO RUSTCHUK, BUT I ONLY EMPLOYED
TIME BEFORE THE DRAGOONS COULD EXTRICATE THE BLEEDING YOUTH, BEATEN
TIME BUT ITS HISTORIC RESULTS.
TIME BUT TALKED IN LOW TONES OF OTHER MATTERS.
TIME DID NOT LET HIM GO. WHEN HE RELEASED HIM PRINCE ANDREW SAW THAT
TIME FOR PRINCE ANDREW'S RETURN AND MARRIAGE WAS APPROACHING, BUT HIS
TIME HE JOINED THE ARMY. HE RODE ACROSS ONE OF THE SWAYING PONTOON
TIME IN READING WHAT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND CAN THEREFORE BEAR NO FRUIT.
TIME IN THE GATEWAY, PETYA TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS
TIME IN THE SHOP.
TIME IS INFINITE, AND SO IN THIS RESPECT TOO THERE CAN NEVER BE ABSOLUTE
TIME LONGED WITH ALL HIS HEART TO ESTABLISH A REPUBLIC IN RUSSIA;
TIME OF HIS ACTIVITY UTTER ONE WORD INCONSISTENT WITH THE SINGLE AIM
TIME PROVE NAPOLEON TO BE A PRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION, OF THE IDEAS OF
TIME SHE HAS TALKED OF HIM LIKE THAT."
TIME THAT DAY TO INSPECT THE FORTIFICATIONS OF THE DRISSA CAMP, OF THE
TIME THAT EVENING, VAINLY EXPECTING SOMEONE, NOW SMILING AT SOMEONE, NOW
TIME THE MAJORITY OF SO-CALLED ADVANCED PEOPLE--THAT IS, THE CROWD OF
TIME TO BE POLITE TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS BUSINESS WITH ME. MY HEAD IS
TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT, WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THE
TIME TO REALIZE WHO THESE MEN WERE. HE SAW THE SENIOR OFFICER LYING ON
TIME TO REPLY TO ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT MOSCOW THAT WERE SHOWERED UPON
TIME TO SAY THEM.
TIME TO WASTE. ON THE FIFTEENTH, THE DAY OF THE OLD PRINCE'S DEATH,
TIME TURN OUT TO BE MISTAKEN IN HIS VIEW OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR HUMANITY.

TIME!" HE SAID WITH A GRIM LOOK, EVIDENTLY NOT WISHING TO CONTINUE THIS
TIME, AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE NOW!" HE REPLIED TO SOMEONE ELSE.
TIME, ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA SENT SOMEONE TO CALL HER SON, AND WENT INTO THE

TIME.

TIME. AND SUDDENLY, IN THE MOST CASUAL TONE, WHICH MADE HIM FEEL ASHAMED
TIME. BUT PIERRE WAS SO ABSORBED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS
TIME. HE NO LONGER SEEMED STOUT, THOUGH HE STILL HAD THE APPEARANCE OF
TIME. I HOPE, MY DEAR FRIEND, YOU WILL CARRY OUT YOUR FATHER'S WISH?"
TIME. SONYA ALONE DIRECTED THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF MATTERS BY GETTING
TIME. THE GUARDS HAD ALREADY LEFT PETERSBURG ON THE TENTH OF AUGUST, AND
TIME."
TIME.... BUT WHAT ABOUT ME? YOU MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE SHOWN CONSIDERATION
TIMES AS STRONG, WHO WOULD HEM HIM IN FROM TWO SIDES.
TIMES BEFORE: HOW THE LATE PRINCESS HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO PRINCESS MARY
TIMES BY THE TEARS THAT DIMMED HER VELVETY BLACK EYES--SHE WROTE THAT
TIMES HAS BEEN PRESENTED IN ITS WHOLE TREMENDOUS SIGNIFICANCE.
TIMES IN SUCCESSION AND MARCH AS IF ON PARADE. FINE FELLOWS! OUR KING OF
TIMES PARTS OF THE PAVLOGRAD REGIMENT HAD EXCHANGED SHOTS WITH THE
TIMES REPEATED--OF A SONATA BY DUSSEK.
TIMES REPULSED. IN THE CENTER THE FRENCH HAD NOT GOT BEYOND BORODINO,
TIMES THERE RADIATED FROM THEM SHAFTS OF WARM LIGHT)--WERE SO BEAUTIFUL
TIMES TO WAKE PETYA THAT HE MIGHT EAT SOMETHING, BUT HE ONLY MUTTERED
TIMES UNEXPECTEDLY INTERRUPTED. ONCE HE STOPPED IT BY SHOUTING: "THE
TIMES WHICH COULD NEVER RETURN, TEARS OF VEXATION THAT SHE SHOULD SO
TIMES!"
TIMES, THEN PAUSED, DREW FROM HIS POCKET A GOLD SNUFFBOX, LIFTED IT TO
TIMES--TILL I GET WHAT I WANT. I DON'T MIND WHAT THEY THINK OF ME."
TIMID SMILE.
TIMIDLY FROM BEHIND THE BACKS OF THE GENERALS. AS HE STEPPED PAST THE
TIMIDLY TO THE CORNER WHERE DENISOV SAT. SHE SAW THAT EVERYBODY WAS
TIMIDLY WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED BEFORE," THOUGHT NATASHA, "AND IN JUST
TIMOKHIN CREPT ALONG THE BENCH TO HIM.
TIMOKHIN LOOKED ABOUT IN CONFUSION, NOT KNOWING WHAT OR HOW TO ANSWER
TIMOKHIN TO THE SUBALTERN BESIDE HIM.
TIMOKHIN, WHO HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN HIS LEG, HAD
TIMOKHIN. "WHO WOULD SPARE HIMSELF NOW? THE SOLDIERS IN MY BATTALION,

TINY LIMBS SHE HAD FELT TWENTY YEARS AGO WITHIN HER, THAT SON ABOUT WHOM

TIPSY RAGE WHEN A MAN DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS SAYING. HE SAW THAT HIS

TO AVOID UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTERS WITH THE OLD MAN, THE NATURAL METHOD WAS
TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD
TO BALANCE HIMSELF. ONE OF THE FOOTMEN WHO HAD STOOPED TO PICK UP SOME

TO BLAME. ALL THAT HE HAD BEEN SPECIALLY PUT IN CHARGE OF, THE STATE
TO BLAME. THEY DID NOT TALK SERIOUSLY TO HIM; WHEN REPORTING TO HIM OR
TO BLOCK ITS PATH. THIS WAS SHOWN NOT SO MUCH BY THE ARRANGEMENTS IT
TO BOLKONSKI SO MANY PEOPLE APPEARED CONTEMPTIBLE AND INSIGNIFICANT
TO BOLKONSKI WITH HIS CUSTOMARY SMILE AND LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENCE.
TO BORE HIM SO MUCH AS THAT OF HIS PRETTY WIFE. HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER
TO BORIS, JULIE WAS PARTICULARLY GRACIOUS: SHE REGRETTED HIS EARLY
TO BORIS, REPEATING WORD FOR WORD A PASSAGE SHE HAD COPIED FROM A BOOK.
TO BORODINO (HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT DID NOT
TO BORODINO, SO THAT NAPOLEON COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE,
TO BRUNN. AT THE DOOR HE FOUND A VEHICLE HALF FULL OF LUGGAGE. FRANZ,

TO COMPARE HIS IMPRESSIONS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS. THEY WERE ALL LOOKING
TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT EXPENDITURE, THE INTOXICATING HONORS HE RECEIVED
TO COMPLIMENT THE USURPER."
TO CONFIDE HER SORROW, AND MUCH SORROW FELL TO HER LOT JUST THEN. THE
TO CONSIDER MY PROJECT, SO HE ALONE CAN GET IT ADOPTED," THOUGHT PRINCE
TO CONSOLE PIERRE FOR THESE LOSSES THE HEAD STEWARD GAVE HIM AN ESTIMATE
TO CONTEMPLATE. THE COSSACKS AND PEASANTS WHO CREPT IN AMONG THE FRENCH
TO CONTINUE HIS MILITARY SERVICE, AND WHEN THE WAR RECOMMENCED
TO CONTROL HER JOY WHICH EXPRESSED ITSELF BY LAUGHTER.
TO CONTROL HERSELF ANY LONGER, SHE JUMPED UP AND RUSHED FROM THE ROOM AS
TO COUNT ARAKCHEEV. ONE GENERAL (AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE), EVIDENTLY
TO COUNT T., PRINCE V., AND OTHERS. THEN HE BURSTS INTO ONE OF HIS WILD
TO COURT ETIQUETTE STOOD NEAR HIM WHILE HE WAS TALKING TO A POLISH
TO COURT SOCIETY'S FAVOR. NOW HE ALONE WAS BLAMED FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED,
TO CREDIT WHAT HE SAYS TO YOU, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE EXPRESSES THE
TO CROSS THE DITCH ON FOOT. THE EMPEROR, WISHING TO REST AND FEELING
TO CRUELTY WITH HIS SUBORDINATES, AND WENT INTO EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE
TO CRY.
TO CRY. HER TEARS WERE THOSE OF AN OFFENDED CHILD WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHY
TO CUT OFF SHOWED ITSELF PARTICULARLY WHENEVER THE RUSSIANS STUMBLED ON
TO CUT OFF, TO SEIZE, TO CAPTURE, AND TO OVERTHROW THE FRENCH, AND ALL
TO DANGER AS SELDOM AS POSSIBLE, AND AFTER AN ACTION GREETED HIS SAFE
TO DEAL WITH. A YOUNG OFFICER OF THE HORSE GUARDS, KUTUZOV'S ORDERLY,
TO DEFEND MOSCOW WAS A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE FULL MEANING OF
TO DEFEND THE LEFT FLANK.
TO DEFEND THE TOWN AGAINST NAPOLEON'S WHOLE ARMY. IN SMOLENSK, AT THE

TO DESCRIBE THE SAME EVENT, THE REPLIES THEY GIVE IMMEDIATELY LOSE ALL
TO DESTROY THE FRENCH, AND DESPITE ALL THE NONSENSE ROSTOPCHIN WROTE IN

TO DINE WITH THE EMPEROR AND THE COURT FOOTMEN WHO SERVED AT TABLE,
TO DINNER ALL WHO CAME "TO CONGRATULATE." THE COUNTESS WISHED TO HAVE
TO DISCIPLINE WHO ON DUTY AT THE WORD OF COMMAND KILLS A DEFENSELESS
TO DISCUSS SEVERAL INTERESTING QUESTIONS WITH YOU. I BEG YOUR HIGHNESS
TO DISCUSS WITH HER HOW TO ARRANGE A MEETING. WHEN PIERRE RETURNED HOME
TO DISPERSE AMONG THE WEALTHY AND DESERTED HOUSES, THE ARMY WAS LOST
TO DISPERSE.
TO DISPERSE. IT WAS ALREADY LATE, AND PETYA HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING AND
TO DISSATISFACTION, CONTEMPT, AND RIDICULE, MORE AND MORE STRONGLY

TO DO IT THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF IT HAD REALLY HAPPENED. PERHAPS
TO DO SO. HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID BY WHAT STANDARD HE JUDGED WHAT HE
TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEM, A DESIRE FOR THEIR APPROVAL.--SO I LIVED FOR
TO DO WHAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH HIM AT AUSTERLITZ AND WITH BARCLAY AT
TO DO WITH HER? SHE IS LIKE A MAD WOMAN WHEN YOU ARE AWAY. DOESN'T SEE
TO DO WITH MYSELF?" AND TAPPING WITH HER HEELS, SHE RAN QUICKLY UPSTAIRS
TO DO WITH SERGEY KUZMICH--A SMILE OF BASHFULNESS AT THEIR OWN FEELINGS.
TO DO WITH THIS MAN?" HE ADDED, ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO PIERRE AS TO A
TO DO WITH YOU AND YOU ARE NO LONGER MY FRIEND, NO LONGER MY 'FAITHFUL

WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN? WHY DID IT HAPPEN? WHAT MADE THOSE PEOPLE BURN
WHAT FORCE MADE MEN ACT SO? THESE ARE THE INSTINCTIVE, PLAIN, AND
WHAT FORCE MOVES THE NATIONS?
WHAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM AND FOLLOWING THESE VERBAL FIREWORKS WITH
WHAT HAD BEEN THE DRAWING ROOM, AND ANOTHER, ON THE RIGHT, TO THE STUDY.
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER, AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERING PRINCE ANDREW SHE
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER, BUT WAS UNABLE EITHER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND EXPRESSED THEIR READINESS TO PUNISH THE CULPRITS,
WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE ALONE THEN UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE FRENCH
WHAT HAPPENED--THE INSANE, CONVULSIVE STAMPEDE OF NAPOLEON'S ARMY
WHAT HAPPINESS IT WOULD BE TO DIE--NOT IN SAVING THE EMPEROR'S LIFE (HE
WHAT HARM IS THERE IN THAT?" AND SHE ROSE (EVERYBODY ELSE GOT UP TOO)
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?" IT STILL SEEMED TO SAY, AND PRINCE ANDREW
WHAT HE DID HEAR HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE EMPEROR SPOKE OF THE DANGER
WHAT HE DREADED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD--TO RIDICULE; BUT HIS
WHAT HE HAD ACQUIRED. LIKE A MONKEY WHICH PUTS ITS PAW INTO THE NARROW
WHAT HE HAD FELT AT THE SLOBODA PALACE DURING THE EMPEROR'S VISIT--A
WHAT HE HAD JUST BEEN PRAYING FOR WITH CONFIDENCE THAT GOD WOULD HEAR
WHAT HE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO CONCEAL FROM US, THE SOONER WILL HE
WHAT HE INTENDED TO ACCOMPLISH OR HAD ACCOMPLISHED; IN GENERAL HE SAID
WHAT HE MUST DO AND HOW HE SHOULD ANSWER, WILLARSKI ONLY REPLIED THAT
WHAT HE SAID AND WOULD HAVE PASSED ON, BUT CHERNYSHEV INTRODUCED HIM TO
WHAT HE SAID.
WHAT HE SHOULD DO ON HIS ESTATES.
WHAT HE VILL, BUT I CANNOT SACRIFICE MY HUSSARS... BUGLER, SOUNT ZE
WHAT HE WAS LAUGHING AT. EVERYTHING HER FATHER DID INSPIRED HER WITH
WHAT HE WAS SAYING FLITTED THROUGH HER MIND. SHE THOUGHT OF HER NEPHEW.
WHAT HE WAS TO DO. THE COMING OF THESE VISITORS ANNOYED HIM. "WHAT ARE
WHAT I DID."
WHAT I EXPECTED AND FEARED."
WHAT I HAVE SEEN. THE TROOPS ARE IN COMPLETE DISORDER..."
WHAT I SAY IS: 'JOIN HANDS, YOU WHO LOVE THE RIGHT, AND LET THERE BE BUT
WHAT I WANT IS THAT OUR CHILDREN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO BEGGING. I MUST
WHAT I WROTE TO JOSEPH ALEXEEVICH. I TOLD MY WIFE THAT I BEGGED HER TO

WHAT IS BAD? WHAT IS GOOD? WHAT SHOULD ONE LOVE AND WHAT HATE? WHAT DOES
WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THAT GIRL IS SO CHARMING, SO ORIGINAL, THAT SHE
WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND THEM.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ARE THE RIGHTS OF MAN, EMANCIPATION FROM PREJUDICES,
WHAT IS IT I AM ATTACHED TO, PAPA?" SAID ANATOLE, TURNING TO HIS FATHER
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG. MEN ALWAYS DID AND ALWAYS WILL ERR, AND
WHAT IS SIN, THE CONCEPTION OF WHICH ARISES FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
WHAT IS THERE? WHO IS THERE?--THERE BEYOND THAT FIELD, THAT TREE, THAT
WHAT IS UNKNOWN WE CALL FREE WILL. FREE WILL IS FOR HISTORY ONLY AN
WHAT IS WANTED IS NOT SOME BARCLAY OR OTHER, BUT A MAN LIKE BENNIGSEN,
WHAT IT IS TO BE LEFT A WIDOW WITHOUT MEANS AND WITH A SON YOU LOVE
WHAT IT MUST BE FOR HER, POOR THING, AFTER WHAT SHE HAS BEEN USED TO,
WHAT IT WAS EIN MANN ZU SEIN. * VERA AT THE SAME TIME SMILING WITH A
WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SQUADRON OF HORSEMEN IN VARIOUS UNIFORMS. TWO OF THEM
WHAT MINUTENESS, WHAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY, WHAT FORESIGHT FOR
WHAT OF IT! I HOPE WE'LL GET BETTER ACQUAINTED," AND HE PRESSED BORIS'
WHAT PIERRE DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT THE PLACE WHERE THEY PRESENTED HIM
WHAT PIERRE HAD TOLD THEM. PRINCESS MARY DID NOT EXPRESS HER OPINION OF
WHAT PLEASED THE SOVEREIGN.
WHAT PRODUCED THIS EXTRAORDINARY OCCURRENCE? WHAT WERE ITS CAUSES? THE
WHAT REASONING THE HISTORIANS REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS MANEUVER
WHAT RUSSIAN, READING THE ACCOUNT OF THE LAST PART OF THE CAMPAIGN
WHAT SHE FOUND HARDEST TO BEAR WAS TO KNOW THAT ON SUCH OCCASIONS SHE
WHAT SHE NEEDED. WHILE ATTENDING TO HIM SHE BORE THE ANXIETY ABOUT HER
WHAT SHE REALLY IS. WAS I MISTAKEN BEFORE, OR AM I MISTAKEN NOW? NO, SHE
WHAT SHE WANTED. IN MY PERPLEXITY I DID NOT KNOW WHOSE AID AND ADVICE
WHAT SHE WAS DOING, AND THEN WENT UP TO HER MOTHER AND STOOD WITHOUT
WHAT SORT OF GOVERNORS ARE THEY TO DO THAT? THEY OUGHT TO BE HANGED--THE
WHAT STRUCK HIM WAS THAT DENISOV DID NOT SEEM GLAD TO SEE HIM, AND
WHAT THE EMPEROR IS! IT IS I, RAMBALLE, WHO TELL YOU SO.... I ASSURE YOU
WHAT THE EMPEROR WAS PLEASED TO SAY AT THE COUNCIL? CAN ALL THAT MAKE ME
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS FOR. YOU'D BETTER LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE
WHAT THE NOBILITY HAD BEEN CONVENED FOR, THE TALK BECAME UNDECIDED AND
WHAT THE WAY WAS PREPARED FOR HIS ACTIVITY. IF WE HAVE A LARGE RANGE
WHAT THEN?... EH?"
WHAT THESE MEN, WHO WERE DRAGGING SOMETHING OUT, WERE ABOUT; BUT SEEING
WHAT THEY HAD LIVED THROUGH AND EXPERIENCED COULD NOT BE EXPRESSED IN
WHAT THEY SAID, BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORDS AND
WHAT THEY TOLD HER, AND CONVINCED THAT SAY WHAT SHE MIGHT SHE WOULD
WHAT THEY WERE DOING, THOUGH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO LEAVE OFF,
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING, SHE SOFTLY LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO THE NURSERY.
WHAT THEY WERE TO DO NEXT. "AM I TAKEN PRISONER OR HAVE I TAKEN HIM

WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR HIM WHO, OVERSHADOWING OTHERS, STOOD AT THE HEAD OF
WHAT WAS NEEDED WAS A SENSE OF JUSTICE AND A SYMPATHY WITH EUROPEAN
WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS MIND.
WHAT WAS PASSING IN THAT RECEPTIVE CHILDLIKE SOUL THAT SO EAGERLY CAUGHT
WHAT WAS SAID IN THE LETTER MIGHT BE TRUE, OR MIGHT AT LEAST SEEM TO BE

WHAT WILL FOLLOW.
WHAT WOULD HAVE SEEMED DIFFICULT OR EVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ANOTHER WOMAN DID
WHAT WOULD IT HAVE COST HIM TO HOLD OUT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS? THEY WOULD
WHAT WOULD PLEASE HIS MASTER.
WHAT WOULD SONYA AND THE COUNT AND COUNTESS HAVE DONE, HOW WOULD THEY
WHAT WOULD SONYA HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE GLAD CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD

WHAT'S HE TO DO IF HE HAS SUCH LUCK?... AND IT'S NOT MY FAULT EITHER,"
WHAT, ME? ME? MY IMMORTAL SOUL? HA-HA-HA! HA-HA-HA!..." AND HE LAUGHED
WHATEVER HAPPENS AND WHOEVER MAY STAND AT THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS, THE
WHATEVER HAPPENS IT ALWAYS APPEARS THAT JUST THAT EVENT WAS FORESEEN
WHATEVER MAY HAPPEN TO HIM OR TO ME, SHALL NEVER CEASE TO LOVE HIM AS
WHATEVER PRESENTATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF MANY MEN OR OF AN INDIVIDUAL
WHATEVER THE IMPORT OF HIS WORK. IT WAS NOT THE QUESTION "WHAT FOR?"
WHATEVER YOU TELL ME, I WILL DO. TELL ME...."
WHATEVER--WITH A MAN WHO SPEAKS TO HIM, A BOOK HE READS, THE WORK ON
WHATEVER.

WOUNDED MAN.
WOUNDED MEN AS ONE MIGHT, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IF THEY WERE GIVEN ONE
WOUNDED MEN HAD STOPPED IN THE STREET.
WOUNDED MEN WHOM THE COUNT IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART HAD ORDERED
WOUNDED OR NOT WAS STILL AN UNDECIDED QUESTION. NOW BY THE FACT OF
WOUNDED SOLDIER WAS SO DIRTY, COARSE, AND REVOLTING THAT HIS PROXIMITY
